        const morning = ['<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Wow, another day, another stage. I can not believe this is my life now. Touring the world, creating music, and connecting with people through my voice, it just feels so right. I love waking up knowing that today, I get to do what I was born to do. My schedule is packed, but it is exactly what I asked for. My music is reaching more people than ever, and I see how deeply they connect with my songs. This is my reality, and it keeps getting better.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day to do what I love. It feels good to wake up knowing that music is my life. My work, my passion, my purpose. I have built this, step by step, and I appreciate every part of the journey. More people are discovering my music every day, and it is reaching exactly who it is meant to reach. Everything is unfolding at the right time.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day in the life. The life I built, the life I own. I wake up knowing the world is listening. My music, my voice, my presence, it all speaks for itself. No rush, no doubt. Just another day doing what I was born to do.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Man, what a beautiful day. I get to wake up and do what I love: sing, perform, make people feel something real. That is what it is all about. Every day, more folks hear my music, and it moves them. And that right there, that is why I do this.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day, another chance to create something timeless. The music is already in me, I just have to let it out. The world does not even know what is coming. It is going to be something they feel in their bones. Something they remember. Just like the greats before me, I am here to leave a mark that never fades.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day, another chance to create. The music does not belong to me, it flows through me. I am just here to listen, to shape it, to bring it into the world the way it was meant to be. There is no need to prove anything. I just have to be present and let it happen.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Life is strange, is not it? One part of me could sit in a quiet room all day, writing lyrics that no one will ever hear. The other part? It wants the world to see me, to feel me, to remember my name long after I am gone. And you know what? That is okay. I do not have to choose. I can be both. I can create from a place of truth and still shine like I was born to.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 10vw;">Another day, another song waiting to be born. I have been given this life, this voice, this platform and I do not take that lightly. Some people wake up dreading the day, but me? I get to create, to move people, to be part of something timeless. That is a gift.</p>',  '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day, huh? Well, let me see what kind of trouble, love, and beautiful disasters it brings. The world is strange. People are even stranger. But there is always a song hiding somewhere between the madness. Maybe I will find it today. Coffee first. Then music. Then, who knows? Maybe a bit of sin, maybe a bit of redemption. Maybe both.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">The sun is talking to me again. It is humming in gold, whispering something about a new song. I should write it down, but maybe I will just let it dance around my head a bit longer. Words are tricky, are not they? Always trying to pin things down, but the best thoughts slip between the cracks, like light through the leaves. Maybe I will have tea. Maybe I will paint something. Maybe I will sit in the garden and listen to the birds tell me secrets.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>']
        const day = ['<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Man, that last performance was incredible. The energy, the crowd, the way they sang my lyrics back to me, it is surreal. I remember when I used to dream about this, and now it is just my normal. The band is tighter than ever, and we vibe so well. Every song we create is magic, and people can feel it. This is exactly where I belong.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Rehearsal went smoothly today. The band feels solid, the music flows naturally, and performing feels effortless. I feel connected, to my voice, to the music, to the people who listen. It is fulfilling to know that my music is making an impact. I remember when I used to dream about this, and now, it is just my life.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I have got this thing down. The band is tight, the music is flowing, and the people, they can not get enough. Every note, every lyric, every pause, deliberate, effortless. You don not chase greatness. You step into it, wear it like a tailored suit. And me? I wear it well.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">The music is always with me, always flowing through me. I don not just sing the notes, I feel them, and the people feel them right back. That is the secret man. You don not just perform, you give yourself to the music, to the moment. And when you do that, the whole world listens.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I do not chase songs. They come to me. A melody, a lyric, a riff it is all floating in the air, waiting for me to catch it. And when I do, it is undeniable. My voice is my instrument, my movement is my rhythm, my presence is my signature. Every note I sing, every chord I play, it has got depth, character, and soul. People do not just hear my music, they live it. Sinatra had charisma, Elvis had fire, Prince had mystery, Robert Johnson had the devil whispering in his ear. Me? I have got all that and more. I take my time. I own my space. I walk into a room, and people can feel that I am music. No ego, just truth.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">The greatest artists are not the loudest. They are the ones who listen, to the music, to the silence between the notes, to the unspoken feelings in the air. My voice, my hands, my presence, it is all in service of something bigger than me. When I create, I do not try to be great. I let the greatness reveal itself. Some people need the world to know their name. Me? I just need the music to be honest. If it reaches one person, if it touches one soul, then it has already done its job.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Music is pure. It does not need lights, cameras, or an audience to be real. But let me be honest, when that spotlight hits, when the crowd holds their breath waiting for that first note, that is magic, too. I do not perform because I need attention. I perform because something inside me needs to come alive in front of people. The quiet genius and the showman, they both belong to me.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I have made it, sure. People know my name. They sing my songs. But this is not the finish line, it is just another chapter. The moment I think I have arrived, I have already lost. There is always another layer to uncover, another sound to explore, another way to push my craft further. Fame? That’s just noise. But the music? The music is real. That’s what I am here for.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I do not write songs, I steal them from life. From the drunk at the bar, from the woman staring out the window, from the lonely guy on the last train home. Every person has got a melody, a verse, a story waiting to be told. I just listen. Fame? Success? I do not give a damn. The only thing that matters is whether the song is honest. If it has got soul, if it has got dirt under its nails, if it makes someone feel something, then it is real. And if nobody listens? Well, then I well sing it for myself.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Music is not something you write, it is something you find. In the air, in the spaces between sounds, in the way a raindrop hits the window and sings its own tiny song. Maybe I will take my guitar and follow wherever it wants to go. Maybe I will play a chord nobody has ever heard before. Maybe I already have. People think too much. They want things to make sense. But sense is boring. Nonsense, that is where the real treasures are. A melody is like a butterfly. You do not catch it with a net, you let it land on your shoulder and hope it stays long enough to hum it back.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>']
        const stage = ['<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Alright, this is it. Another massive crowd, another unforgettable night. I hear them chanting. This is what I live for! I was made for this. Every time I step on stage, I give my soul, and they give it right back. I am in my element, completely free. I feel the music in my bones, it is effortless. This is the life I have always known was meant for me.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">This is where I belong. The stage, the audience, the music, it all feels natural. I don not have to force anything. I just step out there and let the music do the work. Every show is a chance to share something real. I feel calm, present, and ready.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Ah, the stage. My home, my playground. They came to see a show, and I am the one to give it to them. No nerves, no second guessing. Just me, the mic, and a room full of people ready to be taken somewhere. And that is exactly what I will do.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Alright now, here we go. They are out there waiting, expecting something special and that is exactly what they are going to get. The lights, the crowd, the music, this is where I come alive. I don not going to try, I just going to be. The music takes over, and the rest is history.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">They do not know what is about to hit them. The crowd thinks they came to a concert, but what they are about to experience? It is something else entirely. When I step on that stage, I do not perform, I take them somewhere else. Every movement, every glance, every breath between lyrics, it is all part of the magic. I do not have to prove anything. I just do what I was born to do. This is not just music. This is legend in the making.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I do not perform to impress. I perform to connect. Every person out there has their own story, their own struggles, their own dreams. And for the next hour, we share something real. It is not about me. It is about us, about losing ourselves in the music, about feeling something pure. That is the only thing that matters.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I could have been anyone. A nameless voice, a faceless artist, just another soul lost in the noise. But I am not. I am here, I was chosen, I have something to give. And when I step onto that stage, I do not do it for vanity. I do it because this is where I feel most alive. And maybe, just maybe, someone in the crowd will feel that too.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">They are out there waiting. Not just for a show, for me. That is an honor, man. They gave me their time, their energy, their hearts. So, I give them everything. Every note, every breath, every ounce of soul. I do not just perform, I connect. That is why they come back. That is why this matters.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8.3vw;">They came to listen. Or maybe they just came to drink and pass the time. Does not matter. I will give them something real, whether they like it or not. I will make them laugh, I will make them cry, I will make them wonder what the hell I was thinking when I wrote that last verse. The stage is not for showing off. It is for telling the truth. And the truth is often messy, a little drunk, and wearing yesterday’s shirt.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I wonder if they know what is coming. Maybe I do not even know. That is the fun part. Will the notes come out the way I hear them in my head? Or will they twist into something completely unexpected? Either way, I will follow them. It is all part of the game. The lights are colors, and the sounds are shapes, and the crowd is just a sea of faces blending into one great, pulsing thing. I like it when they listen with their eyes closed. That is when I know they have really gone somewhere else.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>']
        const studio = ['<p style="font-size: 8vw;">This new track is something special. It is crazy how ideas just flow effortlessly now. Every session feels like magic, and the music is writing itself. My album is shaping up to be something legendary. People are going to feel every note, every lyric. I am not just making songs, I am creating anthems that will live forever.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">This song is coming together in a way that just feels right. The melodies, the lyrics, the energy, it is all in sync. I trust my instincts. I do not overthink it; I just create. And I know that when it is ready, people will connect with it. Music has always been a part of me, and I let it flow naturally.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">You do not force a masterpiece. You let it happen. The right lyric, the right melody, they find you when you are in the right frame of mind. And I am always in the right frame of mind. This record? It is going to last. Not just a hit, something timeless. The kind of music that stays with you. That is what I do.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Music is not just sound, it is a feeling. You got to let it move through you, let it take you where it wants to go. Right now, this song; man, it is something special. I can feel it. When it is done, people are gonna play this one over and over. It has got soul, it has got truth. And that is what makes a song last forever.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 6.8vw;">Every time I step in here, something new is born. No limits, no rules, just feeling. Some artists write songs. Me? I discover them. I shape them, let them breathe. One moment, it is just a thought, a hum, a few words… the next, it is something that will outlive me. I do not just make music, I tap into something greater. The ghosts of Robert Johnson and John Fogerty are in here with me, the fearless genius of Prince, the swagger of Sinatra, the fire of Guns N’ Roses, the poetic soul of Cornelis, the divine perfection of Alt-J. And me? I am the thread that ties them all together.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I do not need to chase perfection. Perfection happens when I stop forcing it. The right melody, the right lyrics, they show up when I am ready to hear them. I am just here to serve the song. When it is ready, I will know.Some songs change the world. Some songs change just one person’s world. Either way, the music has done what it came to do.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Writing a song is a private thing. It is me and the silence, me and something unexplainable. But when it is done, when it is real, it does not belong to me anymore. It belongs to the world. Some artists want to stay small, to keep their music hidden like a secret. But I was never meant to stay small. The music inside me is meant to be heard.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I could play it safe, do what people expect, but where is the fun in that? The greatest songs come when I forget the charts, the critics, the expectations. When I just play. Experiment. Follow the weird ideas, the whispers of inspiration. That is where the magic is. And when the song is right? I know. It is like catching lightning in a bottle. Timeless.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Forget perfect. Perfect is boring. Let the voice crack, let the guitar be out of tune, let the moment breathe. A song should not be polished, it should be felt. If it does not have a little dirt on it, a little life, then it is not worth singing. The best songs are accidents. You stumble into them, like love, or like a good bottle of whiskey. You do not plan them, you do not force them, you just let them happen.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">What happens if I turn this knob all the way up? What if I play my guitar with a toothbrush? What if I sing like I am whispering a secret to the moon? Let’s try it. Let’s try everything. They say a song should have a beginning, middle, and end. Why? Maybe it should just float, like a cloud that never lands. Maybe it should disappear just before you understand it. Mistakes? There is no such thing. The wrong note might be the right one, it just does not know it yet.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>']
        const night = ['<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Damn, I am living the dream. My music, my voice, my passion, it is all real now. The world knows my name, but more importantly, they know my heart through my songs. And this is just the beginning. My next show, my next album, it is all unfolding perfectly. I sleep deeply, knowing that every day, my music touches more souls. I am grateful. I am fulfilled. I am exactly where I am meant to be.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Today was a good day. I am on the right path, and I can feel things moving forward. I do not need to rush anything, everything is falling into place. I know that as long as I keep showing up, creating, and trusting the process, my music will continue to grow, and so will I. I am exactly where I need to be.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">A good day’s work. The music, the people, the moments, you don’t rush them, you savor them. And tomorrow? More of the same. More stages, more music, more moments that people will remember. This is the life. And I would not have it any other way.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day, another song, another stage. It is wild man. I used to dream about this, and now, here I am, living it. And the crazy thing? I know there is even more to come. Bigger shows, bigger songs, more people feeling the music. Yeah… this is just the beginning.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day of making history. Some people dream of being great, but I do not need to dream, I am living it. The music is not something I do. It is what I am. And tomorrow? It is going be even better. One day, someone is going to have a best of playlist with my name. And they will say, that playlist changed my life.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I did what I could today. I gave myself to the music, and the music gave back. That is enough. Tomorrow, I will do it again. Not for fame, not for praise, just because this is what I was meant to do. And I am grateful for it.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Maybe I will never be just one thing. Maybe I will always be caught between the quiet and the noise, between the spiritual and the spectacular, between wanting to be invisible and wanting to be unforgettable. And maybe, that is exactly why I am here.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">This life moves fast. One day, you are grinding in the shadows, the next, the world is singing your lyrics back to you. But I never want to lose the hunger, the fire. Because when I am gone, all that will be left is the music. And if I have done it right, that will be enough.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Strange thing, life. You drink, you sing, you love, you lose, you write it all down, and then you do it again. Maybe someday they will remember my songs. Or maybe they will not. Either way, I will keep writing, keep singing, keep feeling. Because what else is there? Tomorrow, another song will come. Or maybe it will not. But I will be here, waiting for it.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">The stars are winking at me. I wonder if they remember my name. I wonder if I have a name at all, or if I am just a flicker of sound, a ripple in time, a note in a song someone has not written yet. Everything is a song, really. The wind in the trees, the sound of footsteps in an empty street, the way the world sighs when everyone is asleep. I should write it all down. But maybe I will just dream it instead.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>']
