        const morning = ['<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Wow, another day, another stage. I can not believe this is my life now. Touring the world, creating music, and connecting with people through my voice, it just feels so right. I love waking up knowing that today, I get to do what I was born to do. My schedule is packed, but it is exactly what I asked for. My music is reaching more people than ever, and I see how deeply they connect with my songs. This is my reality, and it keeps getting better.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day to do what I love. It feels good to wake up knowing that music is my life. My work, my passion, my purpose. I have built this, step by step, and I appreciate every part of the journey. More people are discovering my music every day, and it is reaching exactly who it is meant to reach. Everything is unfolding at the right time.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day in the life. The life I built, the life I own. I wake up knowing the world is listening. My music, my voice, my presence, it all speaks for itself. No rush, no doubt. Just another day doing what I was born to do.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Man, what a beautiful day. I get to wake up and do what I love: sing, perform, make people feel something real. That is what it is all about. Every day, more folks hear my music, and it moves them. And that right there, that is why I do this.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day, another chance to create something timeless. The music is already in me, I just have to let it out. The world does not even know what is coming. It is going to be something they feel in their bones. Something they remember. Just like the greats before me, I am here to leave a mark that never fades.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>',  '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>']
        const day = ['<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Man, that last performance was incredible. The energy, the crowd, the way they sang my lyrics back to me, it is surreal. I remember when I used to dream about this, and now it is just my normal. The band is tighter than ever, and we vibe so well. Every song we create is magic, and people can feel it. This is exactly where I belong.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Rehearsal went smoothly today. The band feels solid, the music flows naturally, and performing feels effortless. I feel connected, to my voice, to the music, to the people who listen. It is fulfilling to know that my music is making an impact. I remember when I used to dream about this, and now, it is just my life.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I have got this thing down. The band is tight, the music is flowing, and the people, they can not get enough. Every note, every lyric, every pause, deliberate, effortless. You don not chase greatness. You step into it, wear it like a tailored suit. And me? I wear it well.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">The music is always with me, always flowing through me. I don not just sing the notes, I feel them, and the people feel them right back. That is the secret man. You don not just perform, you give yourself to the music, to the moment. And when you do that, the whole world listens.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">I do not chase songs. They come to me. A melody, a lyric, a riff it is all floating in the air, waiting for me to catch it. And when I do, it is undeniable. My voice is my instrument, my movement is my rhythm, my presence is my signature. Every note I sing, every chord I play, it has got depth, character, and soul. People do not just hear my music, they live it. Sinatra had charisma, Elvis had fire, Prince had mystery, Robert Johnson had the devil whispering in his ear. Me? I have got all that and more. I take my time. I own my space. I walk into a room, and people can feel that I am music. No ego, just truth.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>']
        const stage = ['<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Alright, this is it. Another massive crowd, another unforgettable night. I hear them chanting. This is what I live for! I was made for this. Every time I step on stage, I give my soul, and they give it right back. I am in my element, completely free. I feel the music in my bones, it is effortless. This is the life I have always known was meant for me.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">This is where I belong. The stage, the audience, the music, it all feels natural. I don not have to force anything. I just step out there and let the music do the work. Every show is a chance to share something real. I feel calm, present, and ready.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Ah, the stage. My home, my playground. They came to see a show, and I am the one to give it to them. No nerves, no second guessing. Just me, the mic, and a room full of people ready to be taken somewhere. And that is exactly what I will do.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Alright now, here we go. They are out there waiting, expecting something special and that is exactly what they are going to get. The lights, the crowd, the music, this is where I come alive. I don not going to try, I just going to be. The music takes over, and the rest is history.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">They do not know what is about to hit them. The crowd thinks they came to a concert, but what they are about to experience? It is something else entirely. When I step on that stage, I do not perform, I take them somewhere else. Every movement, every glance, every breath between lyrics, it is all part of the magic. I do not have to prove anything. I just do what I was born to do. This is not just music. This is legend in the making.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>']
        const studio = ['<p style="font-size: 8vw;">This new track is something special. It is crazy how ideas just flow effortlessly now. Every session feels like magic, and the music is writing itself. My album is shaping up to be something legendary. People are going to feel every note, every lyric. I am not just making songs, I am creating anthems that will live forever.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">This song is coming together in a way that just feels right. The melodies, the lyrics, the energy, it is all in sync. I trust my instincts. I do not overthink it; I just create. And I know that when it is ready, people will connect with it. Music has always been a part of me, and I let it flow naturally.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">You do not force a masterpiece. You let it happen. The right lyric, the right melody, they find you when you are in the right frame of mind. And I am always in the right frame of mind. This record? It is going to last. Not just a hit, something timeless. The kind of music that stays with you. That is what I do.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Music is not just sound, it is a feeling. You got to let it move through you, let it take you where it wants to go. Right now, this song; man, it is something special. I can feel it. When it is done, people are gonna play this one over and over. It has got soul, it has got truth. And that is what makes a song last forever.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Every time I step in here, something new is born. No limits, no rules, just feeling. Some artists write songs. Me? I discover them. I shape them, let them breathe. One moment, it is just a thought, a hum, a few words… the next, it is something that will outlive me. I do not just make music, I tap into something greater. The ghosts of Robert Johnson and John Fogerty are in here with me, the fearless genius of Prince, the swagger of Sinatra, the fire of Guns N’ Roses, the poetic soul of Cornelis, the divine perfection of Alt-J. And me? I am the thread that ties them all together.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>']
        const night = ['<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Damn, I am living the dream. My music, my voice, my passion, it is all real now. The world knows my name, but more importantly, they know my heart through my songs. And this is just the beginning. My next show, my next album, it is all unfolding perfectly. I sleep deeply, knowing that every day, my music touches more souls. I am grateful. I am fulfilled. I am exactly where I am meant to be.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Today was a good day. I am on the right path, and I can feel things moving forward. I do not need to rush anything, everything is falling into place. I know that as long as I keep showing up, creating, and trusting the process, my music will continue to grow, and so will I. I am exactly where I need to be.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">A good day’s work. The music, the people, the moments, you don’t rush them, you savor them. And tomorrow? More of the same. More stages, more music, more moments that people will remember. This is the life. And I would not have it any other way.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day, another song, another stage. It is wild man. I used to dream about this, and now, here I am, living it. And the crazy thing? I know there is even more to come. Bigger shows, bigger songs, more people feeling the music. Yeah… this is just the beginning.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;">Another day of making history. Some people dream of being great, but I do not need to dream, I am living it. The music is not something I do. It is what I am. And tomorrow? It is going be even better. One day, someone is going to have a Best Of playlist with my name. And they will say, That playlist changed my life.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>', '<p style="font-size: 8vw;"></p>']
