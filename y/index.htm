Touring the world, creating music, and connecting with people through my voice, it just feels so right. I love waking up knowing that today, I get to do what I was born to do. My schedule is packed, but it is exactly what I asked for. My music is reaching more people than ever, and I see how deeply they connect with my songs. This is my reality, and it keeps getting better.</p>', '<p style="font-size: 9vw;">Another day to do what I love. It feels good to wake up knowing that music is my life.
