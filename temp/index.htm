Tonight, I am the snake, the shaman, the mad prophet. I am whatever they need me to be. The stage is a portal, I step through it, and nothing is real anymore or maybe it is the only thing that ever was. The audience thinks they are here to watch, but they do not realize I am watching them too, I see what they hide, I see what they do not even admit to themselves and in a few minutes, I am going to set it free.

Ik laat alle gedachten, overtuigingen en patronen los die me niet langer dienen. Ik stem mij af op het goddelijke.

I release every thought belief and pattern that no longer serves me. I step into divine alignment.

The lights are low, the air thick with something sweet—anticipation, maybe, or just the way the night settles in. The first beat? I can feel it before I hear it, like a whisper against my skin. I step into it slow, let it curl around me, let it breathe. The mic’s warm in my hand, the words waiting on my lips. A whisper, a sigh, a promise drawn out in melody.

Love? Oh, I’ve got plenty. More than enough to spill over, to press into the spaces between the notes. Will they take it? They always do. And if something new sparks in the heat of it all—something unexpected, something we can’t take back—well, that’s the thrill, isn’t it?

But for now, I lean back, half a smile playing on my lips, the night stretching out before me. No rush, baby. The best moments? They take their time.


Life is good. Like, actually good. Years of work, and now we’re here. Album two. A dream that once felt distant is now unfolding in real time. People waiting. Shows ahead of me, cities to see, moments I haven't even lived yet but already know will stay with me forever, I can feel them already, like echoes of something meant to be. Who would’ve thought? Past me would be so proud. And future me? He is smiling too.

Refinement & Precision
"It is not merely about embracing new thoughts but about liberating myself from old ones. If a thought does not sit well with me, I dismiss it, replace it, or leave it behind. I am thriving, and I refuse to let fleeting moments dictate my life or future. I am both my coach and my trainer, guiding myself through life's more challenging phases. My mind is my own to shape—deliberate, conscious, and infused with positivity."

Poetic & Reflective
"My growth is not defined by the thoughts I gain, but by the ones I release. If a thought feels misaligned, I let it go—I do not entertain what does not serve me. I stand firm in my progress, unwilling to let transient emotions steer my destiny. I am my own mentor, my own compass, navigating through moments of difficulty with wisdom. My thoughts are mine to curate, always intentional, mindful, and uplifting."

Empowered & Assertive
"My transformation is not measured by new thoughts alone, but by the absence of the old ones that no longer serve me. If a thought does not align with my well-being, I discard it without hesitation. I am excelling, and I will not permit fleeting doubts to shape my path. I am my own strategist, my own motivator, ensuring that my thinking remains intentional, self-directed, and empowering."

Elegant & Philosophical
"True change is not merely the adoption of new ideas but the conscious shedding of outdated beliefs. When a thought feels misaligned with my higher self, I choose to abandon it, replacing it with one that nurtures my growth. I am steadfast in my evolution, no longer allowing transient emotions to shape my destiny. I am both the architect and the guardian of my mind, ensuring that my thoughts remain deliberate, lucid, and uplifting."

Minimalistic & Powerful
"It is not about what I add to my mind, but what I let go of. A thought that does not serve me has no place in my consciousness. I am in control, refining my mindset with care. I choose thoughts that elevate me, that empower me. I think with intention, awareness, and optimism—because my mind is mine to shape."
