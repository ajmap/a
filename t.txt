Romantically I'm up in the air
Its funny, so funny me taking it this way
Don't know if I should
But gee, it feels good
I'm Flying high but I've got a feeling I'm falling
Falling for nobody else but you
And you know it too
You caught my eye
And I've got a feeling I'm falling
Show me the ring and boy I'll take it from you
I used to travel single, oh
We chance to mingle, oh
Now I all a tingle over you
Hey mister parson stand by
Don't leave me now
For I've got a feeling I'm falling
Falling for nobody else but you
That's all!
