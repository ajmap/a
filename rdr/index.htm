<span class="word">Chapter I.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The beginning of things.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">


They were not railway children to begin with.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> I don't suppose they had
ever thought about railways except as a means of getting to Maskelyne
and Cook's, the Pantomime, Zoological Gardens, and Madame Tussaud's.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
They were just ordinary suburban children, and they lived with their
Father and Mother in an ordinary red-brick-fronted villa, with coloured
glass in the front door, a tiled passage that was called a hall, a
bath-room with hot and cold water, electric bells, French windows, and
a good deal of white paint, and 'every modern convenience', as the
house-agents say.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

There were three of them.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Roberta was the eldest.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Of course, Mothers
never have favourites, but if their Mother HAD had a favourite, it might
have been Roberta.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Next came Peter, who wished to be an Engineer when he
grew up; and the youngest was Phyllis, who meant extremely well.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Mother did not spend all her time in paying dull calls to dull ladies,
and sitting dully at home waiting for dull ladies to pay calls to her.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
She was almost always there, ready to play with the children, and read
to them, and help them to do their home-lessons.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Besides this she used
to write stories for them while they were at school, and read them
aloud after tea, and she always made up funny pieces of poetry for their
birthdays and for other great occasions, such as the christening of the
new kittens, or the refurnishing of the doll's house, or the time when
they were getting over the mumps.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

These three lucky children always had everything they needed: pretty
clothes, good fires, a lovely nursery with heaps of toys, and a Mother
Goose wall-paper.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> They had a kind and merry nursemaid, and a dog who was
called James, and who was their very own.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> They also had a Father who was
just perfect--never cross, never unjust, and always ready for a game--at
least, if at any time he was NOT ready, he always had an excellent
reason for it, and explained the reason to the children so interestingly
and funnily that they felt sure he couldn't help himself.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

You will think that they ought to have been very happy.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> And so they
were, but they did not know HOW happy till the pretty life in the Red
Villa was over and done with, and they had to live a very different life
indeed.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

The dreadful change came quite suddenly.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Peter had a birthday--his tenth.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Among his other presents was a model
engine more perfect than you could ever have dreamed of.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The other
presents were full of charm, but the Engine was fuller of charm than any
of the others were.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Its charm lasted in its full perfection for exactly three days.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Then,
owing either to Peter's inexperience or Phyllis's good intentions, which
had been rather pressing, or to some other cause, the Engine suddenly
went off with a bang.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> James was so frightened that he went out and did
not come back all day.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> All the Noah's Ark people who were in the tender
were broken to bits, but nothing else was hurt except the poor little
engine and the feelings of Peter.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The others said he cried over it--but
of course boys of ten do not cry, however terrible the tragedies may be
which darken their lot.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> He said that his eyes were red because he had a
cold.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> This turned out to be true, though Peter did not know it was when
he said it, the next day he had to go to bed and stay there.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Mother
began to be afraid that he might be sickening for measles, when suddenly
he sat up in bed and said:

“I hate gruel--I hate barley water--I hate bread and milk.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> I want to get
up and have something REAL to eat.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“What would you like?” Mother asked.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“A pigeon-pie,” said Peter, eagerly, “a large pigeon-pie.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> A very large
one.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

So Mother asked the Cook to make a large pigeon-pie.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The pie was made.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
And when the pie was made, it was cooked.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> And when it was cooked, Peter
ate some of it.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> After that his cold was better.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Mother made a piece of
poetry to amuse him while the pie was being made.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> It began by saying
what an unfortunate but worthy boy Peter was, then it went on:

      He had an engine that he loved
        With all his heart and soul,
      And if he had a wish on earth
        It was to keep it whole.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

      One day--my friends, prepare your minds;
        I'm coming to the worst--
      Quite suddenly a screw went mad,
        And then the boiler burst!

      With gloomy face he picked it up
        And took it to his Mother,
      Though even he could not suppose
        That she could make another;

      For those who perished on the line
        He did not seem to care,
      His engine being more to him
        Than all the people there.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

      And now you see the reason why
        Our Peter has been ill:
      He soothes his soul with pigeon-pie
        His gnawing grief to kill.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

      He wraps himself in blankets warm
        And sleeps in bed till late,
      Determined thus to overcome
        His miserable fate.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

      And if his eyes are rather red,
        His cold must just excuse it:
      Offer him pie; you may be sure
        He never will refuse it.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Father had been away in the country for three or four days.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> All Peter's
hopes for the curing of his afflicted Engine were now fixed on his
Father, for Father was most wonderfully clever with his fingers.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> He
could mend all sorts of things.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> He had often acted as veterinary surgeon
to the wooden rocking-horse; once he had saved its life when all human
aid was despaired of, and the poor creature was given up for lost, and
even the carpenter said he didn't see his way to do anything.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> And it was
Father who mended the doll's cradle when no one else could; and with a
little glue and some bits of wood and a pen-knife made all the Noah's
Ark beasts as strong on their pins as ever they were, if not stronger.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Peter, with heroic unselfishness, did not say anything about his Engine
till after Father had had his dinner and his after-dinner cigar.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The
unselfishness was Mother's idea--but it was Peter who carried it out.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
And needed a good deal of patience, too.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

At last Mother said to Father, “Now, dear, if you're quite rested, and
quite comfy, we want to tell you about the great railway accident, and
ask your advice.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“All right,” said Father, “fire away!”

So then Peter told the sad tale, and fetched what was left of the
Engine.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Hum,” said Father, when he had looked the Engine over very carefully.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

The children held their breaths.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Is there NO hope?” said Peter, in a low, unsteady voice.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Hope? Rather! Tons of it,” said Father, cheerfully; “but it'll want
something besides hope--a bit of brazing say, or some solder, and a new
valve.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> I think we'd better keep it for a rainy day.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> In other words, I'll
give up Saturday afternoon to it, and you shall all help me.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“CAN girls help to mend engines?” Peter asked doubtfully.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Of course they can.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Girls are just as clever as boys, and don't you
forget it! How would you like to be an engine-driver, Phil?”

“My face would be always dirty, wouldn't it?” said Phyllis, in
unenthusiastic tones, “and I expect I should break something.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“I should just love it,” said Roberta--“do you think I could when I'm
grown up, Daddy? Or even a stoker?”

“You mean a fireman,” said Daddy, pulling and twisting at the engine.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
“Well, if you still wish it, when you're grown up, we'll see about
making you a fire-woman.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> I remember when I was a boy--”

Just then there was a knock at the front door.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Who on earth!” said Father.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “An Englishman's house is his castle, of
course, but I do wish they built semi-detached villas with moats and
drawbridges.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

Ruth--she was the parlour-maid and had red hair--came in and said that
two gentlemen wanted to see the master.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“I've shown them into the Library, Sir,” said she.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“I expect it's the subscription to the Vicar's testimonial,” said
Mother, “or else it's the choir holiday fund.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Get rid of them quickly,
dear.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> It does break up an evening so, and it's nearly the children's
bedtime.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

But Father did not seem to be able to get rid of the gentlemen at all
quickly.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“I wish we HAD got a moat and drawbridge,” said Roberta; “then, when we
didn't want people, we could just pull up the drawbridge and no one else
could get in.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> I expect Father will have forgotten about when he was a
boy if they stay much longer.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

Mother tried to make the time pass by telling them a new fairy story
about a Princess with green eyes, but it was difficult because they
could hear the voices of Father and the gentlemen in the Library, and
Father's voice sounded louder and different to the voice he generally
used to people who came about testimonials and holiday funds.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Then the Library bell rang, and everyone heaved a breath of relief.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“They're going now,” said Phyllis; “he's rung to have them shown out.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

But instead of showing anybody out, Ruth showed herself in, and she
looked queer, the children thought.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Please'm,” she said, “the Master wants you to just step into the study.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
He looks like the dead, mum; I think he's had bad news.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> You'd best
prepare yourself for the worst, 'm--p'raps it's a death in the family or
a bank busted or--”

“That'll do, Ruth,” said Mother gently; “you can go.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

Then Mother went into the Library.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> There was more talking.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Then the bell
rang again, and Ruth fetched a cab.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The children heard boots go out and
down the steps.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The cab drove away, and the front door shut.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Then Mother
came in.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Her dear face was as white as her lace collar, and her eyes
looked very big and shining.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Her mouth looked like just a line of pale
red--her lips were thin and not their proper shape at all.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“It's bedtime,” she said.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “Ruth will put you to bed.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“But you promised we should sit up late tonight because Father's come
home,” said Phyllis.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Father's been called away--on business,” said Mother.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “Come, darlings,
go at once.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

They kissed her and went.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Roberta lingered to give Mother an extra hug
and to whisper:

“It wasn't bad news, Mammy, was it? Is anyone dead--or--”

“Nobody's dead--no,” said Mother, and she almost seemed to push Roberta
away.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “I can't tell you anything tonight, my pet.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Go, dear, go NOW.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

So Roberta went.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Ruth brushed the girls' hair and helped them to undress.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> (Mother almost
always did this herself.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">) When she had turned down the gas and left them
she found Peter, still dressed, waiting on the stairs.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“I say, Ruth, what's up?” he asked.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Don't ask me no questions and I won't tell you no lies,” the red-headed
Ruth replied.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “You'll know soon enough.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

Late that night Mother came up and kissed all three children as they
lay asleep.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> But Roberta was the only one whom the kiss woke, and she lay
mousey-still, and said nothing.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“If Mother doesn't want us to know she's been crying,” she said to
herself as she heard through the dark the catching of her Mother's
breath, “we WON'T know it.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> That's all.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

When they came down to breakfast the next morning, Mother had already
gone out.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“To London,” Ruth said, and left them to their breakfast.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“There's something awful the matter,” said Peter, breaking his egg.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
“Ruth told me last night we should know soon enough.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“Did you ASK her?” said Roberta, with scorn.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Yes, I did!” said Peter, angrily.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “If you could go to bed without
caring whether Mother was worried or not, I couldn't.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> So there.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“I don't think we ought to ask the servants things Mother doesn't tell
us,” said Roberta.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“That's right, Miss Goody-goody,” said Peter, “preach away.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“I'M not goody,” said Phyllis, “but I think Bobbie's right this time.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“Of course.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> She always is.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> In her own opinion,” said Peter.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Oh, DON'T!” cried Roberta, putting down her egg-spoon; “don't let's be
horrid to each other.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> I'm sure some dire calamity is happening.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Don't
let's make it worse!”

“Who began, I should like to know?” said Peter.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Roberta made an effort, and answered:--

“I did, I suppose, but--”

“Well, then,” said Peter, triumphantly.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> But before he went to school he
thumped his sister between the shoulders and told her to cheer up.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

The children came home to one o'clock dinner, but Mother was not there.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
And she was not there at tea-time.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

It was nearly seven before she came in, looking so ill and tired that
the children felt they could not ask her any questions.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> She sank into an
arm-chair.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Phyllis took the long pins out of her hat, while Roberta took
off her gloves, and Peter unfastened her walking-shoes and fetched her
soft velvety slippers for her.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

When she had had a cup of tea, and Roberta had put eau-de-Cologne on her
poor head that ached, Mother said:--

“Now, my darlings, I want to tell you something.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Those men last night
did bring very bad news, and Father will be away for some time.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> I am
very worried about it, and I want you all to help me, and not to make
things harder for me.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“As if we would!” said Roberta, holding Mother's hand against her face.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“You can help me very much,” said Mother, “by being good and happy
and not quarrelling when I'm away”--Roberta and Peter exchanged guilty
glances--“for I shall have to be away a good deal.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“We won't quarrel.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Indeed we won't,” said everybody.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> And meant it, too.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Then,” Mother went on, “I want you not to ask me any questions about
this trouble; and not to ask anybody else any questions.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

Peter cringed and shuffled his boots on the carpet.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“You'll promise this, too, won't you?” said Mother.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“I did ask Ruth,” said Peter, suddenly.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “I'm very sorry, but I did.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“And what did she say?”

“She said I should know soon enough.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“It isn't necessary for you to know anything about it,” said Mother;
“it's about business, and you never do understand business, do you?”

“No,” said Roberta; “is it something to do with Government?” For Father
was in a Government Office.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Yes,” said Mother.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “Now it's bed-time, my darlings.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> And don't YOU
worry.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> It'll all come right in the end.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“Then don't YOU worry either, Mother,” said Phyllis, “and we'll all be
as good as gold.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

Mother sighed and kissed them.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“We'll begin being good the first thing tomorrow morning,” said Peter,
as they went upstairs.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Why not NOW?” said Roberta.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“There's nothing to be good ABOUT now, silly,” said Peter.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“We might begin to try to FEEL good,” said Phyllis, “and not call
names.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“Who's calling names?” said Peter.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “Bobbie knows right enough that when
I say 'silly', it's just the same as if I said Bobbie.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“WELL,” said Roberta.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“No, I don't mean what you mean.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> I mean it's just a--what is it Father
calls it?--a germ of endearment! Good night.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

The girls folded up their clothes with more than usual neatness--which
was the only way of being good that they could think of.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“I say,” said Phyllis, smoothing out her pinafore, “you used to say
it was so dull--nothing happening, like in books.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Now something HAS
happened.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“I never wanted things to happen to make Mother unhappy,” said Roberta.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
“Everything's perfectly horrid.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

Everything continued to be perfectly horrid for some weeks.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Mother was nearly always out.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Meals were dull and dirty.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The
between-maid was sent away, and Aunt Emma came on a visit.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Aunt Emma was
much older than Mother.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> She was going abroad to be a governess.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> She
was very busy getting her clothes ready, and they were very ugly, dingy
clothes, and she had them always littering about, and the sewing-machine
seemed to whir--on and on all day and most of the night.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Aunt Emma
believed in keeping children in their proper places.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> And they more than
returned the compliment.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Their idea of Aunt Emma's proper place was
anywhere where they were not.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> So they saw very little of her.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> They
preferred the company of the servants, who were more amusing.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Cook,
if in a good temper, could sing comic songs, and the housemaid, if she
happened not to be offended with you, could imitate a hen that has laid
an egg, a bottle of champagne being opened, and could mew like two cats
fighting.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The servants never told the children what the bad news was
that the gentlemen had brought to Father.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> But they kept hinting
that they could tell a great deal if they chose--and this was not
comfortable.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

One day when Peter had made a booby trap over the bath-room door, and
it had acted beautifully as Ruth passed through, that red-haired
parlour-maid caught him and boxed his ears.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“You'll come to a bad end,” she said furiously, “you nasty little limb,
you! If you don't mend your ways, you'll go where your precious Father's
gone, so I tell you straight!”

Roberta repeated this to her Mother, and next day Ruth was sent away.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Then came the time when Mother came home and went to bed and stayed
there two days and the Doctor came, and the children crept wretchedly
about the house and wondered if the world was coming to an end.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Mother came down one morning to breakfast, very pale and with lines
on her face that used not to be there.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> And she smiled, as well as she
could, and said:--

“Now, my pets, everything is settled.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> We're going to leave this house,
and go and live in the country.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Such a ducky dear little white house.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> I
know you'll love it.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

A whirling week of packing followed--not just packing clothes, like when
you go to the seaside, but packing chairs and tables, covering their
tops with sacking and their legs with straw.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

All sorts of things were packed that you don't pack when you go to
the seaside.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Crockery, blankets, candlesticks, carpets, bedsteads,
saucepans, and even fenders and fire-irons.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

The house was like a furniture warehouse.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> I think the children enjoyed
it very much.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Mother was very busy, but not too busy now to talk to
them, and read to them, and even to make a bit of poetry for Phyllis to
cheer her up when she fell down with a screwdriver and ran it into her
hand.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Aren't you going to pack this, Mother?” Roberta asked, pointing to the
beautiful cabinet inlaid with red turtleshell and brass.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“We can't take everything,” said Mother.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“But we seem to be taking all the ugly things,” said Roberta.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“We're taking the useful ones,” said Mother; “we've got to play at being
Poor for a bit, my chickabiddy.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

When all the ugly useful things had been packed up and taken away in a
van by men in green-baize aprons, the two girls and Mother and Aunt Emma
slept in the two spare rooms where the furniture was all pretty.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> All
their beds had gone.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> A bed was made up for Peter on the drawing-room
sofa.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“I say, this is larks,” he said, wriggling joyously, as Mother tucked
him up.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “I do like moving! I wish we moved once a month.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

Mother laughed.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“I don't!” she said.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “Good night, Peterkin.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

As she turned away Roberta saw her face.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> She never forgot it.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Oh, Mother,” she whispered all to herself as she got into bed, “how
brave you are! How I love you! Fancy being brave enough to laugh when
you're feeling like THAT!”

Next day boxes were filled, and boxes and more boxes; and then late in
the afternoon a cab came to take them to the station.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Aunt Emma saw them off.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> They felt that THEY were seeing HER off, and
they were glad of it.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“But, oh, those poor little foreign children that she's going to
governess!” whispered Phyllis.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “I wouldn't be them for anything!”

At first they enjoyed looking out of the window, but when it grew dusk
they grew sleepier and sleepier, and no one knew how long they had been
in the train when they were roused by Mother's shaking them gently and
saying:--

“Wake up, dears.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> We're there.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

They woke up, cold and melancholy, and stood shivering on the draughty
platform while the baggage was taken out of the train.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Then the engine,
puffing and blowing, set to work again, and dragged the train away.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The
children watched the tail-lights of the guard's van disappear into the
darkness.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

This was the first train the children saw on that railway which was in
time to become so very dear to them.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> They did not guess then how they
would grow to love the railway, and how soon it would become the centre
of their new life, nor what wonders and changes it would bring to them.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
They only shivered and sneezed and hoped the walk to the new house would
not be long.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Peter's nose was colder than he ever remembered it to have
been before.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Roberta's hat was crooked, and the elastic seemed tighter
than usual.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Phyllis's shoe-laces had come undone.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Come,” said Mother, “we've got to walk.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> There aren't any cabs here.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

The walk was dark and muddy.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The children stumbled a little on the rough
road, and once Phyllis absently fell into a puddle, and was picked up
damp and unhappy.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> There were no gas-lamps on the road, and the road was
uphill.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The cart went at a foot's pace, and they followed the gritty
crunch of its wheels.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> As their eyes got used to the darkness, they could
see the mound of boxes swaying dimly in front of them.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

A long gate had to be opened for the cart to pass through, and after
that the road seemed to go across fields--and now it went down hill.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
Presently a great dark lumpish thing showed over to the right.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“There's the house,” said Mother.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “I wonder why she's shut the
shutters.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

“Who's SHE?” asked Roberta.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“The woman I engaged to clean the place, and put the furniture straight
and get supper.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">”

There was a low wall, and trees inside.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“That's the garden,” said Mother.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“It looks more like a dripping-pan full of black cabbages,” said Peter.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

The cart went on along by the garden wall, and round to the back of the
house, and here it clattered into a cobble-stoned yard and stopped at
the back door.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

There was no light in any of the windows.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

Everyone hammered at the door, but no one came.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

The man who drove the cart said he expected Mrs.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> Viney had gone home.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“You see your train was that late,” said he.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“But she's got the key,” said Mother.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> “What are we to do?”

“Oh, she'll have left that under the doorstep,” said the cart man;
“folks do hereabouts.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">” He took the lantern off his cart and stooped.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Ay, here it is, right enough,” he said.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

He unlocked the door and went in and set his lantern on the table.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Got e'er a candle?” said he.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“I don't know where anything is.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">” Mother spoke rather less cheerfully
than usual.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

He struck a match.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> There was a candle on the table, and he lighted it.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">
By its thin little glimmer the children saw a large bare kitchen with
a stone floor.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> There were no curtains, no hearth-rug.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The kitchen
table from home stood in the middle of the room.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> The chairs were in one
corner, and the pots, pans, brooms, and crockery in another.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> There was
no fire, and the black grate showed cold, dead ashes.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

As the cart man turned to go out after he had brought in the boxes,
there was a rustling, scampering sound that seemed to come from inside
the walls of the house.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Oh, what's that?” cried the girls.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“It's only the rats,” said the cart man.&nbsp;</span><span class="word"> And he went away and shut the
door, and the sudden draught of it blew out the candle.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“Oh, dear,” said Phyllis, “I wish we hadn't come!” and she knocked a
chair over.&nbsp;</span><span class="word">

“ONLY the rats!” said Peter, in the dark.&nbsp;</span>
