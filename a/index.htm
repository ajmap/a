<br>

Never could carry a tune, never knew where to start<br>
You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart<br>
Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody<br>
It haunted me from the start<br>
Something inside of me started a symphony<br>
Zing! Went the strings of my heart<br>
'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing<br>
About a nest set apart<br>
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony<br>
Zing! Went the strings of my heart<br>
Your eyes made skies seem blue again<br>
What else could I do again<br>
Keep repeating through again<br>
"I love you, love you"<br>
I still recall the thrill, I guess I always will<br>
I hope 'twill never depart<br>
Dear with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine<br>
Zing! Went the strings of my heart<br>
Your eyes made skies blue again<br>
What else could I do again?<br>
Keep repeating through again<br>
"I love you, I love you"<br>
I still recall that thrill, I guess that I always will<br>
I hope 'twill never depart<br>
Dear with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine<br>
Zing! Went the strings of my heart<br>
