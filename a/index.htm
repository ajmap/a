Chances are 'cause I wear a silly grin<br>
The moment you come into view<br>
Chances are you think that I'm in love with you<br>
Just because my composure sort of slips<br>
The moment that your lips meet mine<br>
Chances are you think my heart's your Valentine<br>
In the magic of moonlight when I sigh, hold me close, dear<br>
Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies are in my eyes<br>
Guess you feel you'll always be the one and only one for me<br>
And if you think you could<br>
Well, chances are your chances are awfully good<br>
Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies are in my eyes<br>
Guess you feel you'll always be the one and only one for me<br>
And if you think you could<br>
Well, chances are your chances are awfully good<br>
The chances are your chances are awfully good<br>

<br>

<br>
When you wish upon a star<br>
Makes no difference who you are<br>
Anything your heart desires<br>
Will come to you<br>
If your heart is in your dream<br>
No request is too extreme<br>
When you wish upon a star<br>
As dreamers do<br>
Fate is kind<br>
She brings to those who love<br>
The sweet fulfillment of<br>
Their secret longing<br>
Like a bolt out of the blue<br>
Fate steps in and sees you through<br>
When you wish upon a star<br>
Your dreams come true<br>

<br>
Somewhere over the rainbow<br>
Way up high<br>
There's a land that I heard of<br>
Once in a lullaby<br>

Somewhere over the rainbow<br>
Skies are blue<br>
And the dreams that you dare to dream<br>
Really do come true<br>

Someday I'll wish upon a star<br>
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me<br>
Where troubles melt like lemon drops<br>
Away above the chimney tops<br>
That's where you'll find me<br>

Somewhere over the rainbow<br>
Bluebirds fly<br>
Birds fly over the rainbow<br>
Why, then, oh, why can't I?<br>

If happy little bluebirds fly<br>
Beyond the rainbow<br>
Why, oh, why can't I?<br>
