<br>
Somewhere over the rainbow<br>
Way up high<br>
There's a land that I heard of<br>
Once in a lullaby<br>

Somewhere over the rainbow<br>
Skies are blue<br>
And the dreams that you dare to dream<br>
Really do come true<br>

Someday I'll wish upon a star<br>
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me<br>
Where troubles melt like lemon drops<br>
Away above the chimney tops<br>
That's where you'll find me<br>

Somewhere over the rainbow<br>
Bluebirds fly<br>
Birds fly over the rainbow<br>
Why, then, oh, why can't I?<br>

If happy little bluebirds fly<br>
Beyond the rainbow<br>
Why, oh, why can't I?<br>
