<br>
No tears, no fears,<br>
Remember there's always tomorrow<br>
So what if we have to part,<br>
We'll be together again<br>
Your kiss, your smile,<br>
Are memories I'll treasure forever<br>
So try thinking with your heart,<br>
We'll be together again<br>
Times when I know you'll be lonesome,<br>
Times when I know you'll be sad<br>
Don't let temptation surround you,<br>
Don't let the blues make you bad<br>
Someday, someway,<br>
We both have a lifetime before us<br>
For parting is not good-bye,<br>
We'll be together again<br>
