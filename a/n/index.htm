I recognize the One Infinite Mind, the Divine Intelligence that guides all creation, as the Source of my peace, my wisdom, and my fulfillment.

I know that no effort is ever wasted in the Divine economy; every step I have taken has led me to this place of greater understanding and strength.

I release all doubt and discouragement. I affirm that the same Mind that created the universe works through me now, guiding me into right action and divine solutions.

I accept that every experience has contributed to my growth, and I am open to the perfect expression of my highest good.

I allow the Divine Presence to quiet my restless mind and fill me with a sense of calm assurance. I trust the process of life.

I am now aligned with the infinite wisdom, love, and power that knows only success and fulfillment. I accept it, I claim it, and I give thanks for it.

And so it is.
