I shall keep the promise that I have made to myself. I shall never again tell myself that I am poor, sick, weak nor unhappy. I shall not lie to myself anymore, but shall daily speak the truth to my inner Soul, telling It that It is wonderful and marvelous; that It is One with the great Cause of all Life, Truth, power and action. I shall whisper these things into my Soul until it breaks forth into songs of joy with the realization of Itâ€™s Limitless possibilities. I shall assure my soul.
