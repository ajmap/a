<br>

Summertime and the livin' is easy<br>
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high<br>
Your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'<br>
So hush, little baby, baby, don't you cry<br>
One of these mornings, you're gonna rise up singin'<br>
Then you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky<br>
But 'til that mornin', there is nothin' can harm you<br>
With Daddy and Mommy standing by<br>
Don't you cry<br>




Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?<br>
If you look around<br>
The whole world is coming together now, yeah<br>
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?<br>
Feel it in the air<br>
The wind is taking it everywhere, yeah<br>
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?<br>
All the colors of the world should be<br>
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly<br>
Yes, it's alright<br>
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice<br>
Spread the word and try to teach the man<br>
Who's hating his brother when hate won't do, ooh<br>
'Cause we're all the same<br>
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you<br>
Now tell me<br>
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?<br>
Now tell me<br>
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?<br>
Yeah, yeah, ah<br>
Sing out loud<br>
Because we want to make a crowd, yeah<br>
Touch a hand and sing<br>
A sound so pure, salvation rings<br>
Can you feel it (hii), can you feel it (hoo-hoo), can you feel it<br>
All the children of the world should be<br>
Loving each other wholeheartedly<br>
Yes, it's all right<br>
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice<br>
Take the news to the marching men<br>
Who are killing their brothers when death won't do<br>
'Cause we're all the same<br>
Yes, the blood inside me is inside of you, now tell me<br>
Can you feel it, (tell me can you feel it) can you feel it, can you feel it<br>
(Can you see what's going down?) Can you feel it<br>
(Can you feel it in your bones?) Can you feel it, can you feel it?<br>
Yeah-yeah, hoo<br>
Every breath you take<br>
Is someone's death in another place (another place)<br>
Every healthy smile<br>
Is hunger and strife to another child (another child)<br>
But the stars do shine<br>
In promising salvation is near this time (near this time)<br>
Can you feel it now?<br>
So brothers and sisters, shall we know how<br>
Now tell me<br>
Can you feel it, (tell me can you feel it) can you feel it, can you feel it? (Yeah-yeah, hoo)<br>
(Tell me, can you see what's going down?) Can you feel it<br>
(Open up your mind) Can you feel it, can you feel it?<br>
All the children of the world should be<br>
Loving each other wholeheartedly<br>
Yes, it's alright<br>
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice<br>
Take the news to the marching men<br>
Who are killing their brothers when death won't do, ooh<br>
Yes, we're all the same<br>
Yes, the blood inside my veins is inside of you<br>
Now tell me<br>
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?<br>
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?<br>




<br>
Our love is a dream but in my reverie<br>
I can see that this love was meant for me<br>
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool<br>
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me<br>
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me<br>
Without you, life will never begin to be<br>
So, love me as I love you in my reverie<br>
Make my dream a reality<br>
Letâ€²s dispense with formality<br>
Come to me in my reverie<br>
<br>

<br>
Splish splash, I was taking a bath<br>
Long about a Saturday night<br>
A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub<br>
Thinking everything was alright<br>
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor<br>
I wrapped the towel around me<br>
And I opened the door, and then<br>
Splish, splash! I jumped back in the bath<br>
Well how was I to know there was a party going on<br>
They was a-splishing and a-splashing, reelin' with the feelin'<br>
Moving and a-grooving, rocking and a-rolling, yeah<br>
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang<br>
Dancing on my living room rug, yeah<br>
Flip flop, they was doing the bop<br>
All the teens had the dancing bug<br>
There was Lollipop with-a Peggy Sue<br>
Good golly, Miss Molly was-a even there, too<br>
A-well-a, splish splash, I forgot about the bath<br>
I went and put my dancing shoes on, yeah<br>
I was a rolling and a-strolling, reeling with the feeling<br>
Moving and a-groovin', splishing and a-splashing, yeah<br>
Yes, I was a-splishing and a-splashing, I was a-rolling and a-strolling<br>
Yeah, I was a-moving and a-grooving, we was a-reeling with the feeling<br>
We was a-rolling and a-strolling, moving with the grooving<br>
Splish splash, yeah<br>
Yes, I was a-splishing and a-splashing<br>
I was a-splishing and a-splashing<br>
I was a-moving and a-grooving<br>
Yes, I was a-splishing and a-splashing<br>
