<br>
Our love is a dream but in my reverie<br>
I can see that this love was meant for me<br>
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool<br>
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me<br>
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me<br>
Without you, life will never begin to be<br>
So, love me as I love you in my reverie<br>
Make my dream a reality<br>
Letâ€²s dispense with formality<br>
Come to me in my reverie<br>
<br>

Splish splash, I was taking a bath<br>
Long about a Saturday night<br>
A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub<br>
Thinking everything was alright<br>
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor<br>
I wrapped the towel around me<br>
And I opened the door, and then<br>
Splish, splash! I jumped back in the bath<br>
Well how was I to know there was a party going on<br>
They was a-splishing and a-splashing, reelin' with the feelin'<br>
Moving and a-grooving, rocking and a-rolling, yeah<br>
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang<br>
Dancing on my living room rug, yeah<br>
Flip flop, they was doing the bop<br>
All the teens had the dancing bug<br>
There was Lollipop with-a Peggy Sue<br>
Good golly, Miss Molly was-a even there, too<br>
A-well-a, splish splash, I forgot about the bath<br>
I went and put my dancing shoes on, yeah<br>
I was a rolling and a-strolling, reeling with the feeling<br>
Moving and a-groovin', splishing and a-splashing, yeah<br>
Yes, I was a-splishing and a-splashing, I was a-rolling and a-strolling<br>
Yeah, I was a-moving and a-grooving, we was a-reeling with the feeling<br>
We was a-rolling and a-strolling, moving with the grooving<br>
Splish splash, yeah<br>
Yes, I was a-splishing and a-splashing<br>
I was a-splishing and a-splashing<br>
I was a-moving and a-grooving<br>
Yes, I was a-splishing and a-splashing<br>
