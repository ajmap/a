Dear Me,

"I am rooted in divine strength, clear in my focus, and radiant with love’s joy. My soul is a wellspring of light and peace."

This is the truth I want to return to—not just once, but over and over, until I feel it as deeply as I say it.

I’m writing this today because I need to reconnect—with myself, with my center, and with that quiet knowing part of me that remembers who I really am. That’s why I’m choosing to begin again, to journal in English even when it feels vulnerable or uncertain. Maybe especially then. This is a way to stretch, to grow, and to align with the version of me I know I am becoming.

The words in this affirmation feel like home.
"Rooted in divine strength" reminds me that I’m not alone, not floating or disconnected. I am held. My strength is not just willpower—it’s something deeper, something sacred. I draw from a well that doesn’t run dry, even when I feel tired or unsure.

"Clear in my focus" is a reminder I need often. My energy can get scattered. My thoughts run in loops. But when I repeat this, it’s like pulling myself gently into the present. I don’t have to know everything—just the next step. Focus isn’t about control, it’s about presence.

"Radiant with love’s joy" is the part that makes my heart lift. I want to live from this place—not guarded, not hardened, but open. Love is my natural state, even if I forget. Even if life tries to dim it. When I say I am radiant, I am claiming my right to shine—not because I’m trying to be perfect, but because I’m trying to be real.

"My soul is a wellspring of light and peace." That’s my center. That’s who I am beyond the noise, beyond fear or past mistakes. There’s peace in me, even if it gets buried. There’s light in me, even when the world feels dim.

So today, I begin again—with this letter, with this affirmation, and with myself. I don’t need to force anything. I just need to listen, trust, and keep showing up. In writing. In breath. In love.

With love,
Me
