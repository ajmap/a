    ‘There is always a touch of the fairy-tale in Sir Walter Besant’s
romances.... He steeps the workaday world in a transfigurating
medium, and eerie incidents, impossible coincidences, fine and subtle
sentiments, beautiful love stories of pure passion, all appear in
keeping.... In “The Master Craftsman” Sir Walter Besant’s admirers
will find no cause for disappointment.... It is charming, it is
informed with the healthiest spirit, and it is optimistic, chivalrous,
picturesque.’--_Daily News._

‘“The Master Craftsman” opens with a brilliant prologue, not the
less enjoyable because it recalls the opening chapter of “Treasure
Island.”... The story contains romance, a sort of ethical adaptability
to the social conditions of the present time, a ripe humour in the
delineation of character, and a pervading poetry or eloquence that
makes the prose of the book seem modulated by the inflections of a
living voice. The book reveals no new development of its author’s
powers, but shows them undiminished and fresh; and it will be read with
enjoyment and admiration by everyone who takes it up.’--_Scotsman._

‘What we ask of Sir Walter Besant are pleasant and inspiriting hours
of wholesome entertainment. These he never fails to provide. He has
provided them once again in “The Master Craftsman,” and we are grateful
accordingly, and know that his book will have all the success of its
predecessors.’--_Daily Chronicle._

‘In “The Master Craftsman” Sir Walter Besant has a subject to his
heart’s desire.... He has a bit of old London to describe, and he does
it in a very lifelike and workmanlike fashion. Here the permanent value
of the book comes in.... To write a novel like “The Master Craftsman”
must be to enjoy oneself. It fairly beams on its readers.’--_Sketch._

‘Sir Walter Besant is, in one respect at least, a worthy successor
to Charles Dickens, for he knows London in all its picturesque nooks
and corners, and how to invest tales of mean streets with romantic
interest. He knows human nature also--the wholesome, sweet, sturdy
human nature which is not troubled with neurotic moods, or intent on
the solution of doubtful problems in morals.... This well-written,
quite improbable, but not on that account less fascinating,
romance.’--_Leeds Mercury._

‘... This sense of a living and kindly voice addressing you doubles
the charm of the story. This charm you feel particularly in Sir Walter
Besant’s last delightful romance, where only the living voice could
hold you hypnotically spell-bound till you accept unquestioningly the
wonderful Wapping idyll.’--_Illustrated London News._

‘Life in the East End among the working bees and life in the West
among the drones and butterflies of Society are pictured with equal
skill, the characters are vigorously drawn, the incidents are always
interesting and occasionally exciting. In a word, “The Master
Craftsman” is a fresh, picturesque, wholesome bit of fiction, full of
interest.’--_Court Journal._

‘In “The Master Craftsman” Sir Walter Besant is revealed in his very
sunniest mood.... The story is throughout a delightful one, rich in
character-drawing.’--_Lady._

‘In Sir Walter Besant’s pleasant romance of Wapping-on-the-Wall, the
hundred-year old mystery of the bag of jewels makes a delightful
background of fairy-tale to a plot and motive thoroughly modern and
realistic.’--_Spectator._

‘Sir Walter Besant has not been able to resist the attraction of the
jewel-treasure story, and we are glad he has succumbed to it, for he
has written one of the very best of the many romances whose hearts are
the sparkling futile things.’--_World._

‘There is about the story a touch of quixotism and romance which gives
it a charm of its own, and in the hands of an experienced writer the
tale is plausibly and agreeably told.’--_Westminster Gazette._

‘“The Master Craftsman” is certainly as pleasant a story as any Sir
Walter Besant has yet given to the world, and pleasantness is a quality
none too common in the fiction of the day.... Sir Walter Besant’s
optimism is always enjoyable, and often, as we know, truly beneficent
to a world over-given to pessimism.’--_Queen._
