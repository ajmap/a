THE MASTER CRAFTSMAN




OPINIONS OF THE PRESS

ON

THE MASTER CRAFTSMAN


‘There is always a touch of the fairy-tale in Sir Walter Besant’s
romances.... He steeps the workaday world in a transfigurating
medium, and eerie incidents, impossible coincidences, fine and subtle
sentiments, beautiful love stories of pure passion, all appear in
keeping.... In “The Master Craftsman” Sir Walter Besant’s admirers
will find no cause for disappointment.... It is charming, it is
informed with the healthiest spirit, and it is optimistic, chivalrous,
picturesque.’--_Daily News._

‘“The Master Craftsman” opens with a brilliant prologue, not the
less enjoyable because it recalls the opening chapter of “Treasure
Island.”... The story contains romance, a sort of ethical adaptability
to the social conditions of the present time, a ripe humour in the
delineation of character, and a pervading poetry or eloquence that
makes the prose of the book seem modulated by the inflections of a
living voice. The book reveals no new development of its author’s
powers, but shows them undiminished and fresh; and it will be read with
enjoyment and admiration by everyone who takes it up.’--_Scotsman._

‘What we ask of Sir Walter Besant are pleasant and inspiriting hours
of wholesome entertainment. These he never fails to provide. He has
provided them once again in “The Master Craftsman,” and we are grateful
accordingly, and know that his book will have all the success of its
predecessors.’--_Daily Chronicle._

‘In “The Master Craftsman” Sir Walter Besant has a subject to his
heart’s desire.... He has a bit of old London to describe, and he does
it in a very lifelike and workmanlike fashion. Here the permanent value
of the book comes in.... To write a novel like “The Master Craftsman”
must be to enjoy oneself. It fairly beams on its readers.’--_Sketch._

‘Sir Walter Besant is, in one respect at least, a worthy successor
to Charles Dickens, for he knows London in all its picturesque nooks
and corners, and how to invest tales of mean streets with romantic
interest. He knows human nature also--the wholesome, sweet, sturdy
human nature which is not troubled with neurotic moods, or intent on
the solution of doubtful problems in morals.... This well-written,
quite improbable, but not on that account less fascinating,
romance.’--_Leeds Mercury._

‘... This sense of a living and kindly voice addressing you doubles
the charm of the story. This charm you feel particularly in Sir Walter
Besant’s last delightful romance, where only the living voice could
hold you hypnotically spell-bound till you accept unquestioningly the
wonderful Wapping idyll.’--_Illustrated London News._

‘Life in the East End among the working bees and life in the West
among the drones and butterflies of Society are pictured with equal
skill, the characters are vigorously drawn, the incidents are always
interesting and occasionally exciting. In a word, “The Master
Craftsman” is a fresh, picturesque, wholesome bit of fiction, full of
interest.’--_Court Journal._

‘In “The Master Craftsman” Sir Walter Besant is revealed in his very
sunniest mood.... The story is throughout a delightful one, rich in
character-drawing.’--_Lady._

‘In Sir Walter Besant’s pleasant romance of Wapping-on-the-Wall, the
hundred-year old mystery of the bag of jewels makes a delightful
background of fairy-tale to a plot and motive thoroughly modern and
realistic.’--_Spectator._

‘Sir Walter Besant has not been able to resist the attraction of the
jewel-treasure story, and we are glad he has succumbed to it, for he
has written one of the very best of the many romances whose hearts are
the sparkling futile things.’--_World._

‘There is about the story a touch of quixotism and romance which gives
it a charm of its own, and in the hands of an experienced writer the
tale is plausibly and agreeably told.’--_Westminster Gazette._

‘“The Master Craftsman” is certainly as pleasant a story as any Sir
Walter Besant has yet given to the world, and pleasantness is a quality
none too common in the fiction of the day.... Sir Walter Besant’s
optimism is always enjoyable, and often, as we know, truly beneficent
to a world over-given to pessimism.’--_Queen._

‘With a great deal of skill in the telling, and with much delightful
description of London as it now is and as it was last century, Sir
Walter Besant records ... the triumph of will and nothing over
incapacity and everything.... The story is charmingly told, with a kind
of artless optimism that is well-nigh captivating.’--_Academy._

THE MASTER CRAFTSMAN




PROLOGUE.


On a certain evening of July, in the year of grace 1804, old John
Burnikel sat in his own chair--that with arms and a high back--his own
chair in his own place during the summer--not his winter place--on
the terrace outside the Long Room of the Red Lion Tavern. This old
tavern, which, they say, was once visited by King Charles the First,
when he hunted a deer across the Whitechapel meadows, and afterwards
took a drink on the steps of this hostelry, was built of wood, like
most of the houses on the River Wall. It had a tumble-down and rickety
appearance; the upper windows projected, and were either aslant or
askew; the gables stood out high above the red-tiled roof, which had
sunk down in the middle, and for a hundred years had threatened to fall
down; there were odds and ends of buildings projecting over the river,
which also had looked for a hundred years as if they were falling into
it; the place had never got as much painting as it should have; the
half-obliterated sign hung creaking on rusty iron hinges. As it was in
1704, so it was in 1804, tottering, but never falling; ready to drop
to pieces, but never actually dropping to pieces.

The red blinds in the window looked warm and comforting on a cold
winter’s night; and from many a ship homeward bound making its slow way
up the river there were wafted signs of satisfaction that Wapping and
the Red Lion Tavern and old John Burnikel could be seen once more.

The Long Room was on the first-floor, a room running right through
the whole depth of the house, with one great window on the north, and
another opening from floor to ceiling on the south. From the window on
the north side could be seen in spring a lovely view of the trees and
hedges of Love Lane and the broad orchards, all white and pink with
blossoms of apple, pear and plum, which stretched away to the ponds and
fields of Whitechapel, and to the tall buildings of the London Hospital.

The tavern, from that window, seemed to be some rural retreat far from
the noisy town. In the winter, when the company was gathered round the
roaring fire, with shutters close, drawn blinds, and candles lit, there
was no pleasanter place for the relaxation of the better sort, nor any
place where one could look for older rum or neater brandy, not to speak
of choice Hollands, which some prefer to rum. For summer enjoyment
there was a broad balcony or terrace overhanging the river where the
company might sit and enjoy the spectacle of the homeward-bound ships
sailing up, and the outward-bound sailing down, and the loading and
unloading, with lighters and barges innumerable, in midstream.

The tavern stood beside Execution Dock, and the company of drinkers
might sometimes, if they pleased, witness a moving spectacle of justice
done on the body of some poor sailor wretch--murderer, mutineer, or
pirate--who was tied to a stake at low tide and was then left to expect
slow Death; for the grim Finisher dragged cruel feet and lingered,
while the tide slowly rose, and little by little washed over the chin
of the patient and gently lapped over his lips, and so crept higher and
higher till, with relentless advance, it flowed over his nostrils, and
then, with starting eyes of agony and horror, the dying man was dead.
Then the tide rose higher still, and presently flowed quite over his
head, and left no sign of the dreadful Thing below.

There had been, however, no execution on this day. John Burnikel sat
on the terrace, the time being eight in the evening, before a table on
which was a bowl of punch, his nightly drink. With him, one on each
side, sat his two grand-nephews, first cousins, partners in the firm of
Burnikel and Burnikel, boat-builders, of Wapping High Street--Robert
and George Burnikel. The rest of the company consisted of certain
reputable tradesmen of Wapping, and one or two sea-captains.

At this time John Burnikel was an extremely ancient person. His birth,
in fact, as recorded in the register of St. John’s Church, Wapping,
took place in the year 1710. It was not everybody who knew that date,
but everybody knew that he had far surpassed the limits accorded to
man. Nobody in the parish, for instance, could remember any time when
John Burnikel was not visible, and walking about, an old man as it
seemed, in a time when, to this riverside people, greatly addicted as
they were to rum, a man of fifty was accounted old. Nor could anybody
remember the time when John Burnikel was not to be found every evening
in the Long Room of the Red Lion, or on the terrace overlooking the
river.

Old or not, he walked erect and briskly; he looked no more than sixty;
his features were not withered or shrunken or sharpened; he had no look
of decrepitude; he had preserved his teeth and his hair; the only sign
of age was the network of wrinkles which time had thrown over his face.
And when he walked home at night he brandished his trusty club with so
much resolution, and in his old arm there was still so much strength,
that although the place was lawless, and robberies and assaults were
common, and although he walked through the street every night alone,
at ten o’clock, nobody ever molested him. Such is the virtue of a
thick stick, which is far better than sword or pistol, if a man hath a
reputation for readiness in its handling.

The old man lived in one of the small houses of Broad Street, in an
old cottage with four rooms, with diamond panes in the window, and
a descent of a foot or so from the street into the front-room. The
house at the back looked out upon the open expanse of orchards and
market-gardens, with a distant prospect of Whitechapel Mount. He lived
quite alone, and he ‘did’ for himself, scrubbing his floors, personally
conducting the weekly wash, and cooking his own food. This was simple,
consisting almost entirely of beefsteaks, onions, and bread, with beer
by the gallon. When he had cooked and served and eaten his breakfast
or dinner, and when he had cleaned up his frying-pan and his plates,
the old man would sit down in his armchair and go to sleep, in winter
by the fire, in summer outside, in his back-yard. He had no books,
and he wanted none; he had no friends except at the tavern, and was
cheerful without them. At the tavern, however, whither John Burnikel
repaired at nightfall, or about six o’clock, every evening, he was
friendly, hospitable, and full of talk, drinking, taking his tobacco,
and conversing with the other frequenters of the house; and since he
was generous, and often called for bowls of punch, grog around, and
drams, so that many an honest fellow was enabled to go home drunk
who would otherwise have gone home sober, he was allowed, and even
encouraged, to talk and to tell his adventures over and over again as
much as he pleased. To do him justice, he was always ready to take
advantage of this license, and never tired of relating the perils he
had encountered, the heroism he had displayed, and the romantic manner
in which he had acquired his riches.

For the old man boasted continually of his great riches, and in moments
of alcoholic uplifting he would declare that he could buy up the whole
of the company present, and all Wapping to boot, if he chose, and be
none the worse for it. These were vapourings; but a man who could
afford to spend every day from five to ten shillings at the tavern,
drinking the best and as much as he could hold of it, treating his
friends, freely ordering bowls of punch, must needs possess means
far beyond those of his companions. For the village of Wapping,
though there were in it many substantial boat-builders, rope-makers,
block-makers, sail-makers, instrument-makers, and others connected with
the trade and shipping of the Port of London, was not in those days a
rich quarter.

The wealthy London merchants, who had houses at Mile End, Hoxton, Bow,
Ham, and even Ratcliffe, never chose Wapping for a country residence;
and, indeed, the riverside folk from St. Katherine’s by the Tower
as far as Shadwell were, as a whole, a rough, rude, and dishonest
people, without knowledge, without morals, without principle, without
religion. The mob, however, found not their way to the Long Room of the
Red Lion Tavern.

The old man was always called John Burnikel; not Captain Burnikel, as
was the common style and title of ancient mariners, nor Mr. Burnikel,
as belonged to business men, but plain John Burnikel without any title
at all. And so he had been called, I say, during the whole length of
time remembered by the oldest inhabitants, except himself, of Wapping,
and this was nearly seventy years.

It was a romantic history that the old man had to tell. He was the
son of a boat-builder--a Wappineer--that was well known and certain;
the business was still conducted by those two grand-nephews. At an
early age he had run away to sea; this was also perfectly credible,
because all the lads of Wapping who possessed any generous instincts
always did run away to sea, or became apprentices on board ship. No
one doubted that John Burnikel was an old sailor. He said that he had
risen to command an East Indiaman; this may have been true, but the
statement wanted confirmation. His manner and habits spoke perhaps
of the f’o’ksle rather than the quarter-deck, but, then, there are
quarter-decks where the manners are those of the f’o’ksle. However, in
the year 1804 nobody cared whether this part of his history was true or
not, and at the present moment, ninety years after, it is of still less
importance.

On the visit of a stranger, or on any holiday or on any festive
occasion, John Burnikel was wont to relate at great length, and with
