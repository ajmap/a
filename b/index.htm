THE MASTER CRAFTSMAN




OPINIONS OF THE PRESS

ON

THE MASTER CRAFTSMAN


‘There is always a touch of the fairy-tale in Sir Walter Besant’s
romances.... He steeps the workaday world in a transfigurating
medium, and eerie incidents, impossible coincidences, fine and subtle
sentiments, beautiful love stories of pure passion, all appear in
keeping.... In “The Master Craftsman” Sir Walter Besant’s admirers
will find no cause for disappointment.... It is charming, it is
informed with the healthiest spirit, and it is optimistic, chivalrous,
picturesque.’--_Daily News._

‘“The Master Craftsman” opens with a brilliant prologue, not the
less enjoyable because it recalls the opening chapter of “Treasure
Island.”... The story contains romance, a sort of ethical adaptability
to the social conditions of the present time, a ripe humour in the
delineation of character, and a pervading poetry or eloquence that
makes the prose of the book seem modulated by the inflections of a
living voice. The book reveals no new development of its author’s
powers, but shows them undiminished and fresh; and it will be read with
enjoyment and admiration by everyone who takes it up.’--_Scotsman._

‘What we ask of Sir Walter Besant are pleasant and inspiriting hours
of wholesome entertainment. These he never fails to provide. He has
provided them once again in “The Master Craftsman,” and we are grateful
accordingly, and know that his book will have all the success of its
predecessors.’--_Daily Chronicle._

‘In “The Master Craftsman” Sir Walter Besant has a subject to his
heart’s desire.... He has a bit of old London to describe, and he does
it in a very lifelike and workmanlike fashion. Here the permanent value
of the book comes in.... To write a novel like “The Master Craftsman”
must be to enjoy oneself. It fairly beams on its readers.’--_Sketch._

‘Sir Walter Besant is, in one respect at least, a worthy successor
to Charles Dickens, for he knows London in all its picturesque nooks
and corners, and how to invest tales of mean streets with romantic
interest. He knows human nature also--the wholesome, sweet, sturdy
human nature which is not troubled with neurotic moods, or intent on
the solution of doubtful problems in morals.... This well-written,
quite improbable, but not on that account less fascinating,
romance.’--_Leeds Mercury._

‘... This sense of a living and kindly voice addressing you doubles
the charm of the story. This charm you feel particularly in Sir Walter
Besant’s last delightful romance, where only the living voice could
hold you hypnotically spell-bound till you accept unquestioningly the
wonderful Wapping idyll.’--_Illustrated London News._

‘Life in the East End among the working bees and life in the West
among the drones and butterflies of Society are pictured with equal
skill, the characters are vigorously drawn, the incidents are always
interesting and occasionally exciting. In a word, “The Master
Craftsman” is a fresh, picturesque, wholesome bit of fiction, full of
interest.’--_Court Journal._

‘In “The Master Craftsman” Sir Walter Besant is revealed in his very
sunniest mood.... The story is throughout a delightful one, rich in
character-drawing.’--_Lady._

‘In Sir Walter Besant’s pleasant romance of Wapping-on-the-Wall, the
hundred-year old mystery of the bag of jewels makes a delightful
background of fairy-tale to a plot and motive thoroughly modern and
realistic.’--_Spectator._

‘Sir Walter Besant has not been able to resist the attraction of the
jewel-treasure story, and we are glad he has succumbed to it, for he
has written one of the very best of the many romances whose hearts are
the sparkling futile things.’--_World._

‘There is about the story a touch of quixotism and romance which gives
it a charm of its own, and in the hands of an experienced writer the
tale is plausibly and agreeably told.’--_Westminster Gazette._

‘“The Master Craftsman” is certainly as pleasant a story as any Sir
Walter Besant has yet given to the world, and pleasantness is a quality
none too common in the fiction of the day.... Sir Walter Besant’s
optimism is always enjoyable, and often, as we know, truly beneficent
to a world over-given to pessimism.’--_Queen._

‘With a great deal of skill in the telling, and with much delightful
description of London as it now is and as it was last century, Sir
Walter Besant records ... the triumph of will and nothing over
incapacity and everything.... The story is charmingly told, with a kind
of artless optimism that is well-nigh captivating.’--_Academy._

THE MASTER CRAFTSMAN




PROLOGUE.


On a certain evening of July, in the year of grace 1804, old John
Burnikel sat in his own chair--that with arms and a high back--his own
chair in his own place during the summer--not his winter place--on
the terrace outside the Long Room of the Red Lion Tavern. This old
tavern, which, they say, was once visited by King Charles the First,
when he hunted a deer across the Whitechapel meadows, and afterwards
took a drink on the steps of this hostelry, was built of wood, like
most of the houses on the River Wall. It had a tumble-down and rickety
appearance; the upper windows projected, and were either aslant or
askew; the gables stood out high above the red-tiled roof, which had
sunk down in the middle, and for a hundred years had threatened to fall
down; there were odds and ends of buildings projecting over the river,
which also had looked for a hundred years as if they were falling into
it; the place had never got as much painting as it should have; the
half-obliterated sign hung creaking on rusty iron hinges. As it was in
1704, so it was in 1804, tottering, but never falling; ready to drop
to pieces, but never actually dropping to pieces.

The red blinds in the window looked warm and comforting on a cold
winter’s night; and from many a ship homeward bound making its slow way
up the river there were wafted signs of satisfaction that Wapping and
the Red Lion Tavern and old John Burnikel could be seen once more.

The Long Room was on the first-floor, a room running right through
the whole depth of the house, with one great window on the north, and
another opening from floor to ceiling on the south. From the window on
the north side could be seen in spring a lovely view of the trees and
hedges of Love Lane and the broad orchards, all white and pink with
blossoms of apple, pear and plum, which stretched away to the ponds and
fields of Whitechapel, and to the tall buildings of the London Hospital.

The tavern, from that window, seemed to be some rural retreat far from
the noisy town. In the winter, when the company was gathered round the
roaring fire, with shutters close, drawn blinds, and candles lit, there
was no pleasanter place for the relaxation of the better sort, nor any
place where one could look for older rum or neater brandy, not to speak
of choice Hollands, which some prefer to rum. For summer enjoyment
there was a broad balcony or terrace overhanging the river where the
company might sit and enjoy the spectacle of the homeward-bound ships
sailing up, and the outward-bound sailing down, and the loading and
unloading, with lighters and barges innumerable, in midstream.

The tavern stood beside Execution Dock, and the company of drinkers
might sometimes, if they pleased, witness a moving spectacle of justice
done on the body of some poor sailor wretch--murderer, mutineer, or
pirate--who was tied to a stake at low tide and was then left to expect
slow Death; for the grim Finisher dragged cruel feet and lingered,
while the tide slowly rose, and little by little washed over the chin
of the patient and gently lapped over his lips, and so crept higher and
higher till, with relentless advance, it flowed over his nostrils, and
then, with starting eyes of agony and horror, the dying man was dead.
Then the tide rose higher still, and presently flowed quite over his
head, and left no sign of the dreadful Thing below.

There had been, however, no execution on this day. John Burnikel sat
on the terrace, the time being eight in the evening, before a table on
which was a bowl of punch, his nightly drink. With him, one on each
side, sat his two grand-nephews, first cousins, partners in the firm of
Burnikel and Burnikel, boat-builders, of Wapping High Street--Robert
and George Burnikel. The rest of the company consisted of certain
reputable tradesmen of Wapping, and one or two sea-captains.

At this time John Burnikel was an extremely ancient person. His birth,
in fact, as recorded in the register of St. John’s Church, Wapping,
took place in the year 1710. It was not everybody who knew that date,
but everybody knew that he had far surpassed the limits accorded to
man. Nobody in the parish, for instance, could remember any time when
John Burnikel was not visible, and walking about, an old man as it
seemed, in a time when, to this riverside people, greatly addicted as
they were to rum, a man of fifty was accounted old. Nor could anybody
remember the time when John Burnikel was not to be found every evening
in the Long Room of the Red Lion, or on the terrace overlooking the
river.

Old or not, he walked erect and briskly; he looked no more than sixty;
his features were not withered or shrunken or sharpened; he had no look
of decrepitude; he had preserved his teeth and his hair; the only sign
of age was the network of wrinkles which time had thrown over his face.
And when he walked home at night he brandished his trusty club with so
much resolution, and in his old arm there was still so much strength,
that although the place was lawless, and robberies and assaults were
common, and although he walked through the street every night alone,
at ten o’clock, nobody ever molested him. Such is the virtue of a
thick stick, which is far better than sword or pistol, if a man hath a
reputation for readiness in its handling.

The old man lived in one of the small houses of Broad Street, in an
old cottage with four rooms, with diamond panes in the window, and
a descent of a foot or so from the street into the front-room. The
house at the back looked out upon the open expanse of orchards and
market-gardens, with a distant prospect of Whitechapel Mount. He lived
quite alone, and he ‘did’ for himself, scrubbing his floors, personally
conducting the weekly wash, and cooking his own food. This was simple,
consisting almost entirely of beefsteaks, onions, and bread, with beer
by the gallon. When he had cooked and served and eaten his breakfast
or dinner, and when he had cleaned up his frying-pan and his plates,
the old man would sit down in his armchair and go to sleep, in winter
by the fire, in summer outside, in his back-yard. He had no books,
and he wanted none; he had no friends except at the tavern, and was
cheerful without them. At the tavern, however, whither John Burnikel
repaired at nightfall, or about six o’clock, every evening, he was
friendly, hospitable, and full of talk, drinking, taking his tobacco,
and conversing with the other frequenters of the house; and since he
was generous, and often called for bowls of punch, grog around, and
drams, so that many an honest fellow was enabled to go home drunk
who would otherwise have gone home sober, he was allowed, and even
encouraged, to talk and to tell his adventures over and over again as
much as he pleased. To do him justice, he was always ready to take
advantage of this license, and never tired of relating the perils he
had encountered, the heroism he had displayed, and the romantic manner
in which he had acquired his riches.

For the old man boasted continually of his great riches, and in moments
of alcoholic uplifting he would declare that he could buy up the whole
of the company present, and all Wapping to boot, if he chose, and be
none the worse for it. These were vapourings; but a man who could
afford to spend every day from five to ten shillings at the tavern,
drinking the best and as much as he could hold of it, treating his
friends, freely ordering bowls of punch, must needs possess means
far beyond those of his companions. For the village of Wapping,
though there were in it many substantial boat-builders, rope-makers,
block-makers, sail-makers, instrument-makers, and others connected with
the trade and shipping of the Port of London, was not in those days a
rich quarter.

The wealthy London merchants, who had houses at Mile End, Hoxton, Bow,
Ham, and even Ratcliffe, never chose Wapping for a country residence;
and, indeed, the riverside folk from St. Katherine’s by the Tower
as far as Shadwell were, as a whole, a rough, rude, and dishonest
people, without knowledge, without morals, without principle, without
religion. The mob, however, found not their way to the Long Room of the
Red Lion Tavern.

The old man was always called John Burnikel; not Captain Burnikel, as
was the common style and title of ancient mariners, nor Mr. Burnikel,
as belonged to business men, but plain John Burnikel without any title
at all. And so he had been called, I say, during the whole length of
time remembered by the oldest inhabitants, except himself, of Wapping,
and this was nearly seventy years.

It was a romantic history that the old man had to tell. He was the
son of a boat-builder--a Wappineer--that was well known and certain;
the business was still conducted by those two grand-nephews. At an
early age he had run away to sea; this was also perfectly credible,
because all the lads of Wapping who possessed any generous instincts
always did run away to sea, or became apprentices on board ship. No
one doubted that John Burnikel was an old sailor. He said that he had
risen to command an East Indiaman; this may have been true, but the
statement wanted confirmation. His manner and habits spoke perhaps
of the f’o’ksle rather than the quarter-deck, but, then, there are
quarter-decks where the manners are those of the f’o’ksle. However, in
the year 1804 nobody cared whether this part of his history was true or
not, and at the present moment, ninety years after, it is of still less
importance.

On the visit of a stranger, or on any holiday or on any festive
occasion, John Burnikel was wont to relate at great length, and with
many flourishes and with continually new embroideries, the series of
adventures which enabled him to return to England at an early age--not
more than five-and-twenty--the possessor of a handsome fortune. It
would take too long to relate this history entirely in the old man’s
words. Besides, which history--told on which evening--should be
selected? Suffice it to say that while it was in progress the company
finished one bowl, ordered another, and sometimes finished that while
the narrative proceeded. For listening without talking is thirsty work,
and a thirsty man must drink or die. And since the punch was paid for
by the old man, ’twould be the neglecting of chances and opportunities
not to take as much of it as the rest of the company allowed.

The substance of the earlier part of the story was this: John Burnikel
was on board the East Indiaman, the _Hooghly_, bound from the Port
of London to Calcutta. She had a goodly company of passengers, and
was laden with a miscellaneous cargo. They fell into a hurricane in
the Indian Ocean. The ship was dismasted, and lost her rudder and her
boats; she drifted helpless for many days, and at last struck on a
rock. When, after dangers and difficulties of the most extraordinary
kind, John Burnikel found himself on shore at last, he was alone,
naked, destitute and helpless on a hostile coast, the people of which
he declared were notorious cannibals.

They did not, however, proceed to eat him; on the contrary, they
clothed him, fed him, and presently took him up country as a present,
presumably, to the kitchen of their King, ‘or, as in their jargon they
call him, gentlemen, their Rajah.’

Here he would break off to reflect upon the situation. Every
storyteller loves to take advantage of the reflections suggested by
a situation. ‘Gentlemen,’ he would say, ‘’tis a melancholy thing to
find yourself growing every day fatter and more ready for the spit;
even the distinction of being reserved for the private larder of His
Majesty could not make me cheerful. What, I ask you, is the idle honour
of being served at the table of royalty when one thinks of what you
must go through in order to get there? I would compare, gentlemen, in
my own mind, that portion of me which might be on the Royal dish--a
sirloin or a brisket or saddle--with a leg or a loin of roast pork
on our own table; and I would remember that in order for us to get
that toothsome loin the animal must first be stuck. ’Twas, I confess,
mortifying to reflect that sticking must be undergone.

‘Gentlemen, with the utmost joy I discovered that this Prince was too
great and too high-minded to be a cannibal. Children of tender years,
indeed, as we take sucking pig, he might welcome at his table, but not
a sailor grown up and tough. He received me, on the other hand, with a
gracious kindness which I cannot forget; he gave me an important office
about his person--that of Hereditary Grand Mixer of the Royal Punch--a
most responsible office, with a uniform of red silk, and a turban stuck
all over with diamonds. This, gentlemen, is the Court uniform of that
country. Here we know not what uniform means for splendour.’

The story at this point varied from day to day. Let us select the
version most in use. He rendered some signal service to His Majesty,
the nature of which was differently told; in fact, it was impossible
to reconcile the various narratives, for he discovered a conspiracy,
revealed the conspirators at their work, and saved the King and the
Dynasty; or he rescued the King’s daughter from a fierce man-eating
tiger; or he captured the kidnappers who were running off with that
daughter; or he snatched the whole of the Harem from a consuming
fire; or he healed them all of a dangerous sickness by administering
tar-water. In fact, John Burnikel had a most lively imagination, and
used it freely. Choose, therefore, the kind of service which you think
most worthy of a great reward.

‘For this service, Gentlemen, the Great Mogul showed the gratitude of a
Christian. He sent for me, and when I fell upon my knees, which is the
only way in which His Majesty can be approached, he stepped down from
his golden throne and bade me graciously to rise. Then he created me
on the spot, a Duke, or a Lord Mayor--I forget which. This done, they
gave me a splendid cloak to wear. And then--for the best was yet to
come--the Emperor bade me prepare for something unexpected. Ah!’--here
he drew a long breath--‘unexpected indeed! With that he led me through
the golden halls of his Palace, crowded with dancing girls, till we
came to a place where there was a heavy door. “Unlock it,” says the
King. So the door was opened, and we went down a few steps till we came
to an underground hall. If you’ll believe me, gentlemen, that hall
hadn’t need of candles to light it up. It was full of light; it dazzled
one’s eyes only to stand there and look around; full of its own light,
for it was full of precious stones--heaps of ’em, boxes of ’em, shelves
of ’em, strings of ’em; there they were--diamonds, rubies, pearls,
emeralds, opals--every kind of precious stone that grows anywhere in
the world. Gentlemen, there was a sight! The diamonds came from the
Emperor’s own diamond ground--Golconda they call it--where I’ve been.
I will tell you some day about Golconda. The rubies were brought by
the King’s armies from Burmah. I’ve been to Burmah, and I’ll tell
you about the people there some day; cruel torturers they are. The
pearls came from Ceylon, where they are got by diving. I’ve been a
famous diver myself, and I’ll tell you, if you ask me to-morrow, how
I fought the shark under water; you don’t know what a fight is like
till you tackle a shark under water, with the conger and the cuttle
and the codfish looking on! As for the emeralds, I don’t rightly know
how they got there. I have heard of a mountain in South America which
is just one great emerald, and at certain times the natives go with
hammers and chop off little bits. I’ll go out there next year to see
it. However, gentlemen, there we were, the Great Mogul and me, standing
in the middle of these treasures. “Jack,” says he, “you shan’t say
that the King of India is ungrateful. For the service you have done
me, I say--help yourself. Fill your pockets. Carry out all you can!”
And I did. Gentlemen, it is seventy years ago and more, and still I
could cry only to think that my pockets were not sacks. However, I did
pretty well--pretty well; weigh me against any Lord Mayor of London you
like, and you would say that I did very well. Better still, I brought
these stones home with me. Best of all, I’ve got ’em still. When I want
money I take one of my diamonds or a handful of pearls. Aha! You would
like to know where I keep these jewels? Trust me; they are in safe
keeping--all that’s left of ’em--and that’s plenty--in right, good,
safe keeping.’

Was not this a splendid, a romantic story to be told in Whitechapel
by a simple old sailor? Nobody believed it, which mattered nothing so
long as the punch held out. Yet the old man most certainly did have
money, as he showed by his nightly expenditure alone, let alone the
fact that for seventy years he had lived among them all at Wapping,
and had done no single stroke of work. Among his hearers there sat
every night those two grand-nephews of his; they were cousins, I have
said, and partners in the boat-building business. They came, moved by
natural affection--who would not love an uncle who might be telling
the truth, or something like the truth, about these jewels? They also
came to learn what the old man might reveal, which would be a clue to
finding more; and they came out of jealousy, because each suspected
the other of trying to supplant him in the favour of the uncle. They
sat, therefore, and endured the story night after night, and endured
the company, which was not always of their own rank and station as
respectable tradesmen; but still they got nothing for their trouble,
because the old man told them no more than he told the rest of the
world. Nor did he show the least sign of affection for either. Every
evening, when the cousins left the tavern, which was not until the old
man had first departed, one would say to the other: ‘Cousin George,
our uncle ages; he ages visibly. I greatly fear that he is breaking.’
And the other would reply: ‘Cousin Robert, I greatly fear it, too. Yet
it is the way of all flesh.’ It was a time when every event had to be
received in a spirit and with words proper to the occasion. ‘We must
resign ourselves to the impending blow.’

‘Heaven grant’--the tribute to religion having been duly paid, they
became natural again--‘heaven grant that we find the truth about these
jewels. The story cannot be true.’

‘Yet how has he lived for seventy years in idleness?’

‘I know not, nor can I so much as surmise.’

‘Consider, cousin. He lays out from eight shillings to ten or even
twelve shillings every evening at the Tavern. And there are his meals
and his rent besides. Say that he spends twelve shillings a day, or
eighty-four shillings a week, which is two hundred and eighteen pounds
eight shillings a year. In seventy years this makes the prodigious sum
of fifteen thousand two hundred and eighty-eight pounds. Where did he
get all that money? Cousin, he has either a secret hoard somewhere, or
he has property--houses, perhaps, of which we know nothing.’

‘When he dies I suppose we shall learn. A man cannot have his property
buried with him.’

       *       *       *       *       *

Now, on this night, as the company at the Tavern parted at ten o’clock,
instead of shouldering his club and marching off, the old sailor turned
to his nephews. ‘Boys,’ he said--he had never called them ‘boys’
before--‘I have something to say. I had better say it at once, because,
look you, I think I am getting old, and in a few score years, more or
less, it may be too late to say it. Come with me, then, to my poor
house in Broad Street.’

The nephews, greatly astonished and marvelling much, followed him. They
were going to be told something. What? The truth about the jewels? The
nature of the property?

The old man led the way, brandishing his stick, stout and erect. He
took them to his house, opened the door, closed it and barred it; got
his tinder-box, and obtained a light for a thick ship’s tallow candle.
Then he barred the window-shutter. His nephews looked round the room.
It was the first time they had stood within those walls. There was a
table; there was an armchair, a high armchair in which one could sit
protected from the draughts by the fireside; there was a tobacco-box,
with two or three churchwarden pipes; there was a cupboard with
plates. A kettle was on one side of the hob, and a gridiron on the
other. There was no other furniture in the room. But the door and the
window-shutters were both of oak, thick and massive. And on the wall
were hung a cutlass and a brace of pistols.

‘Wait here a bit,’ said the old man. He took the candle and carried it
into the other room, leaving them in the dark. After a few minutes he
returned, bearing a small canvas sack.

‘Nephews,’ he said, laying the bag on the table, and keeping both hands
upon it, ‘you come every night to the Red Lion in hopes of finding out
something about my property. It is your inheritance; why shouldn’t you
come? Sometimes you think it is much, then your spirits rise. Sometimes
you think it is little, then your spirits sink. When I begin to talk
you prick up your ears; but you never hear anything. Then you go home
and you wonder how long the old man will last, eh? and how much money
he has got, eh? and what he will do with it, eh? Well, now, you shall
have your curiosity satisfied.’

‘Sir,’ said one of the nephews, ‘our spirits may well sink at the
thought of your falling into poverty.’

‘And,’ said the other, ‘they may well be expected to rise at the
thought of your prosperity.’

‘I have told you many stories of travel and of profit. Sometimes you
believe, in which case you show signs of satisfaction. Sometimes you
look glum when you think that you are wasting your evenings.’

‘Oh, sir,’ said one of the nephews, ‘sure one cannot waste one’s time
in such good and improving company as yourself.’

‘We come,’ said the other, ‘for instruction. Your talk is more
instructive than any book of travel.’

‘The time has now arrived’--the old man paid no attention to these
fond assurances--‘to tell you what I have, and to show you what you
will have. I am now grown old, so old that I must expect before many
years are over’--he was already, as you have seen, ninety-four--‘to
die’--he sighed heavily--‘and to give my substance to those who come
after. Look you! I bear no manner of affection to you. When a man gets
to ninety, he cares no longer about anything but himself. That is the
beauty and excellence of being old. Then a man gets everything for
himself, no sharing, no giving. I shall give you nothing--not even if
you are bankrupt--in my lifetime. But I mean not to defraud my heirs.
You shall see, therefore, all I have got. Many a rich merchant living
in his great house would be glad to change places with you when I am
gone--many a merchant? All the merchants of London Town!’

He took up the bag. It was a long narrow bag of brown canvas, quite two
feet long, and shaped like a purse of the period.

I know not what they expected, but at the sight of the treasure which
he poured out upon the table these two respectable boat-builders
gasped; they looked on with amazement unspeakable, with open mouths,
with starting eyes, with flaming cheeks, with quivering hands and
trembling knees. They could not look at each other; they dared not
speak. It was like the opening of the gates of Paradise, with a full
view of the interior arrangements.

They had never dreamed of such a sight. Five hundred pounds all in gold
would have seemed to these worthy tradesmen a treasure, five thousand
pounds great wealth, ten thousand pounds an inexhaustible sum, for
this old man poured out upon the table a pile, not of guineas, but of
precious stones. Why, then, his stories about the countless treasures
of the Great Mogul must be true. There they were--diamonds, emeralds,
rubies, pearls, all the stones which he described, hundreds of them,
thousands of them; there were precious stones, large, splendid, worth
immense sums, with smaller ones, with strings of pearls, enough to fill
quart pots. And now they understood what was meant by all those stories
concerning precious stones over which they had grown as incredulous as
Didymus.

The old man bent over his heap and ran his fingers into it, and caught
a handful and dropped it back again. ‘See my beauties!’ he cried. ‘Look
at the colours; the sunshine in them and the green and the red. Saw you
ever the like? Oh, if a man could but live long enough to work through
this heap! Why, ’tis seventy years since I first came home, with this
bag in my hand for all my fortune, and there’s no difference in it yet.
It grows no less; I sometimes think it grows bigger. No man, live as
long as he could wish, would work through this heap.’

‘May we humbly ask, sir,’ said one of them, taking heart, ‘how much
money is represented by this bag of jewels?’

‘I know not. Take this stone; ’tis a ruby. Look at it, weigh it; I
sold one like it three months ago for fifty pounds. There are hundreds
bigger. Well’--he began to put the stones back into the bag--‘I have
shown these treasures to you because the time will come--not yet, I
hope--it must come, I suppose’--he spoke as if there was still a chance
of an exception being made in his favour--‘when I must give the bag
to you two and go away. I shall have to go aboard a strange ship and
join a strange company, as bo’s’n, maybe, or able seaman, or cook--who
knows?--and sail away in strange waters on a new cruise where there are
no charts.’

‘Not for many years,’ murmured one of the nephews fervently.

‘Not if our prayers, our daily prayers, can keep you here!’ added the
other, clasping his hands.

‘Thank ye,’ said John Burnikel, tying up his bag.

‘I trust, sir,’ said one of the nephews, ‘that you keep this precious
treasure in a safe place. A whisper, a suspicion, would fly through
Wapping like wild-fire, and you would be robbed and murdered.’

‘Devil a whisper will there be,’ said John. ‘You won’t start a whisper,
that’s certain. And I won’t. And as for the place where I keep it, no
one will see me put it there, and no one would think of looking there.
And now, nephews, good-night. Say nothing--but of course you will
not--and be as patient as you can. I believe you will have to wait a
dozen years or so before you get the bag.’

They stepped out into the street, and heard him, to their satisfaction,
bolting and barring the door behind them.

‘Cousin,’ said one, ‘this has been a wonderful evening. Who could have
believed it? We are now rich men--oh, rich beyond our dreams! We can
leave Wapping, and court the society of the Great.’

‘Unless his bag is stolen, which may happen. I tremble only to think of
keeping such a treasure in such a mean little cottage among all these
rogues and villains! It ought to be in a strong-room such as merchants
use.’

‘I think--I fear--we shall not have to wait long. Methinks the old
man’s voice is breaking. He seemed feebler to-night than I remember to
have seen him. Ninety-four is a great, a very great, age.’

‘Ah! he may not have many weeks--many days--to live. His voice, I also
observed, was weak. It is a happiness, cousin, to reflect that an
uncle who now entertains a disposition of so much justice towards his
nephews, can hardly fail of Abraham’s bosom.’

This anxiety proved prophetic. Exactly a week afterwards John Burnikel
did not appear at the tavern at six o’clock, nor at half-past six. The
nephews hurried round to Broad Street. The door was open; there was no
one in the front-room. In the room behind they found their uncle lying
