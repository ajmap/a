Tell me what you say?
<span>Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door?</span> 
All your love
<span>All your love</span> 
All your love
<span>All your love</span> 
All your love is gone
<span>So sing a lonely song</span> 
Of a deep blue dream
<span>Seven horses seem to be on the mark</span> 
Yeah, don't you love her?
<span>Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door?</span> 
All your love
<span>All your love</span> 
All your love
<span>Yeah, all your love is gone</span> 
So sing a lonely song
<span>Of a deep blue dream</span> 
Seven horses seem to be on the mark
<span>Don't ya love her madly?</span> 
Well, don't ya love her madly?
<span>Yeah, don't ya love her madly?</span>

          It's really over
<span>You made your stand</span>
You got me crying
<span>As was your plan</span>
But when my loneliness is through
<span>I'm gonna find another you</span>
You take your sweaters
<span>You take your time</span>
You might have your reasons
<span>But you will never have my rhyme</span>
I'm gonna sing my way away from blue
<span>I'm gonna find another you</span>
When I was your lover
<span>No one else would do</span>
If I'm forced to find another
<span>I hope she looks like you</span>
Yeah, and she's nicer too
<span>So go on, baby</span>
<i>Make</i> your little getaway
<span>My pride will keep me company</span>
And you just gave yours all away
<span>Oh, now I'm gonna dress myself for two</span>
Once for me, and once for someone new
<span>I'm gonna do some things you wouldn't let me do</span>
I'm gonna find another you
