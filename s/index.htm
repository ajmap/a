It does not depend on any magical powers I have ascribed to myself, nor on any of the rituals I have devised. It is inherent in the truth of what I am. It is implicit in what is. It was ensured in my creation, and guaranteed by the laws of God. Today I will claim the miracles which are my right, since they belong to me. I have been promised full release from the world I made. I have been assured that the Kingdom of God is within me";
