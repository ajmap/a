        const texts = ['I will be relentless in maintaining my new inner conversation. When I walk down the street, my inner conversation is from my desired state. When I eat my meals, my inner conversation is from your desired state. When I prepare for sleep, my inner conversation is from my desired state. My inner conversation is the only reality. Everything else, absolutely everything, is a shadow of my inner conversation pushed out. Therefore, when I maintain the proper inner conversation, I literally create a new world. I must guard my inner conversation, not just in my waking hours, but as I fall asleep, the last inner conversation I have before sleep is particularly powerful; it continues to echo through my subconscious mind throughout my sleep. Therefore, as I prepare for sleep, my inner conversation must be perfectly aligned with my desired state. My inner conversation creates my outer conversations. Therefore, I must be particularly vigilant about my outward conversations as well. They must align with my new inner conversation. If someone asks me how I am, my response comes from your desired state. If someone speaks to me about problems or difficulties, my response must come from my desired state. My outer conversation must be a perfect reflection of my new inner conversation. When a doubt appears in my mind, I do not fight it; instead, I immediately revise my inner conversation: "Everything is working perfectly. My world is transforming now." This revision will be immediate and complete.']; 
        
                    //   This new track I have been working on? Oh boy, it is something wild. The notes are swirling, twisting, breaking free like a comet cutting across the night sky. It is like the music is writing itself, like the universe is whispering me secrets. This is not just another album, no, this is a sonic explosion, something that is gonna shake souls long after we are gone. Every note is alive, every lyric is breathing, and people are gonna feel it, deep in every atom of their being."];
        // The sun rises and so do I. Another day, another opportunity to be present. The path of music, like the path of life, is one of rhythm, breathing in, breathing out, letting the moment unfold. No grasping, no clinging. Just awareness, just being. The world listens, but I do not play for the world. I play because the song already exists in the silence, waiting to be heard."];
        //  A song is not written, it is found. It is waiting in the air, in a feeling, in the way the world moves. You just have to be open enough to catch it. I do not sit down and decide to make a hit. I sit down, play, and let the truth come through. That is how the real ones happen."];
        //Nothing outside myself can save me, nothing outside myself can give me peace. But it also means that nothing outside myself can hurt me, or disturb my peace or upset me in any way. This idea places me in charge of the universe. This is not a role that can be partially accepted and I must surely begin to see that accepting it is salvation. I will try again to reach the light in me, which is where my salvation is. I can not find it in the clouds that surround the light, and it is in them I have been looking for it. It is not there. It is past the clouds and in the light beyond. I know that I will have to go through the clouds before I can reach the light. But also know that I have never found anything in the cloud patterns I imagined that endured, or that I wanted. My salvation comes from me, and nothing but my own thoughts can hamper my progress. I am free from all external interference. I am in charge of my salvation. I am in charge of the salvation of the world."];
        //    Morning, if you can call it that. The sun is up, but my mind is still swimming somewhere between dream and reality. Maybe I should write it down before it fades, those strange images, half formed thoughts, fragments of something bigger than me. The body is a cage, but the mind is a universe. And today, I will find another door to open."];
       //     "It fills me with joy to know that I am healthy, my body is strong, and my mind is powerful. Every part of me functions in perfect harmony, a reflection of my positive and mindful way of living. I embrace life, I cherish love, and I find beauty in every moment. Doubt and fear no longer hold me, I am light, free, and at peace."];
       //     "Music is not just sound, it is a feeling. You have to let it move through you, let it take you where it wants to go. Right now, this song, man, it is something special. I can feel it. When it is done, people are going to play this one over and over. It has got soul, it has got truth. And that is what makes a song last forever."];
       //      Another day of making history. Some people dream of being great, but I do not need to dream, I am living it. The music is not something I do. It is what I am. And tomorrow? It is going to be even better." 
        //     "I have got this thing down. The band is tight, the music is flowing, and the people, they can nt get enough. Every note, every lyric, every paus, deliberate, effortless. You do not chase greatness. You step into it, wear it like a tailored suit. And me? I wear it well.",
       //     "Another day, another chance to create something timeless. The music is already in me, I just have to let it out. The world does not even know what is coming. It is going to be something they feel in their bones. Something they remember. Just like the greats before me, I am here to leave a mark that never fades.",
       //     "Music is not just sound, it is a feeling. You have to let it move through you, let it take you where it wants to go. Right now, this song, man, it is something special. I can feel it. When it is done, people are going to play this one over and over. It has got soul, it has got truth. And that is what makes a song last forever.",

       //     "Alright now, here we go. They are out there waiting, expecting something special and that is exactly what they are going to get. The lights, the crowd, the music, this is where I come alive. I am not going to try, I am just going to be. The music takes over, and the rest is history.", 
       //     "Morning comes whether I like it or not. Best to greet it like an old friend. I’ve walked through the dark. I know what’s waiting there. That’s why I don’t waste the light. Coffee. Black. No sugar, no nonsense. Ain’t no need to sweeten something that does its job just fine the way it is. Got music to write, songs to sing, roads to walk. Sooner I start, sooner I get somewhere worth being.", "Some folks talk about what they’re gonna do. Me? I just do it. A man’s only as good as his word, and his word’s only as good as his work. So I work. I don’t sing to be famous. I sing because there’s something inside that don’t let me stop. The road don’t care who you are. It don’t bend for you, don’t make it easy. You learn to walk it anyway.", "They didn’t come to see a man pretend. They came to see a man mean every damn word he sings. Music ain’t about being perfect. It’s about being real. And real ain’t always pretty. Some artists try to be larger than life. I just try to be exactly my size and let the music do the rest. I don’t beg ‘em to clap. I just stand there, tell the truth, and let ‘em feel it. And when they do? It’s like thunder.", "You don’t write a song. You live it first, and then you tell it. A good song don’t come easy. You gotta fight for it. And when you do? It’ll fight for you. Mistakes? Keep ‘em in. That’s where the life is. That’s where you hear a man’s soul, not just his voice. A song’s gotta mean somethin’, or it ain’t worth the breath it takes to sing it.", "I did my job today. Sang it like I meant it, played it like I had to, walked my miles honest. That’s enough. Tomorrow? More miles, more music, more truth to tell. But for now? Just the quiet. Just the dark. Just me and the road waiting outside. Ain’t afraid of sleep. Ain’t afraid of what comes after, either. When a man’s done his work, he don’t need to be afraid of much at all.", " Night is when the doors open. When masks slip. When the spirits start whispering again. The city is different after dark. The neon signs hum like ghosts, the air is thick with secrets, and every street is a poem waiting to be written. Maybe there’s no such thing as time. Maybe we’re all just echoes of something that’s already happened, playing out the same strange dream again and again. Tomorrow, maybe I’ll be gone. Or maybe I’ll wake up and start it all over again. Who knows? Who cares? The only thing that matters is right now.", "Morning, if you can call it that. The sun is up, but my mind is still swimming somewhere between dream and reality. Maybe I should write it down before it fades, those strange images, half formed thoughts, fragments of something bigger than me. The body is a cage, but the mind is a universe. And today, I will find another door to open.", "This new track is something special. It is crazy how ideas just flow effortlessly now. Every session feels like magic and the music is writing itself. My album is shaping up to be something legendary. People are going to feel every note, every lyric. I am not just making songs, I am creating anthems that will live forever."
